\chapter{Semantic Versioning}

In the world of software management there exists a dread place called "dependency hell." The bigger your system grows and the more packages you integrate into your software, the more likely you are to find yourself, one day, in this pit of despair.\footnote{Tom Preston-Werner at \protect\url{semver.org}}

Semantic Versioning of software was propoposed by Tom Preston-Werner. You can read all about it
at semver.org.

Briefly semantic versioning tries to provide a system to be able to help with \enquote{dependency hell}.

Given a version number \texttt{MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH}, increment the:

|MAJOR| version when you make incompatible |API| changes,

|MINOR| version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and

|PATCH| version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the 

|MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH| format.
