\chapter{Semantic Versioning}

In the world of software management there exists a dread place called \enquote{dependency hell}. The bigger your system grows and the more packages you integrate into your software, the more likely you are to find yourself, one day, in this pit of despair.\footnote{Tom Preston-Werner at \protect\url{semver.org}}

Semantic Versioning of software was propoposed by Tom Preston-Werner. You can read all about it
at semver.org.

Briefly semantic versioning tries to provide a system to be able to help with \enquote{dependency hell}.

Given a version number \texttt{MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH}, increment the:

\begin{itemize}
  \item |MAJOR| version when you make incompatible |API| changes,
  \item |MINOR| version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
  \item |PATCH| version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
\end{itemize}

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the 

|MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH| format.
