Specifically, actions are performed before the page is shipped, so they can be used to put watermarks in the background of a page, or to set the page layout. The package reminds in some sense bobhook by Karsten Tinnefeld, but it differs in the way in which the hooks are implemented, as detailed in the following. In some sense it may also be related to the package everyshi by Martin Schroeder, but again the implementation is different.},

@ARTICLE{peterson2009,
  ABSTRACT = {This paper provides an introduction to trace diagrams at a level suitable for advanced undergraduates. Trace diagrams are a non-traditional notation for linear algebra. Vectors are represented by edges in a diagram, and matrices by markings along the edges of the diagram. The notation is rigorous and permits proofs more elegant than those written using traditional notation. We begin with the definition of trace diagrams, and move directly into two special cases that help orient the reader to the diagrammatic point-of-view. We then provide an explicit description of how they are calculated. Finally, we provide the diagrammatic perspective on some questions often posed by students seeing vectors and linear algebra for the first time. We also look at some questions inspired by the diagrammatic notation. We include several examples and exercises throughout, which are particularly important for adjusting to nonstandard notation.},
