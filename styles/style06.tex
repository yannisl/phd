\lettrine{\textcolor{orange}{T}}{}he calligraphic font for this design make it stand out, although you may need to experiment to get the right font (I have used calligra). I am sure the specification can be optimized a bit, however so far it works. I also opted to space out the title. I had to experiment a bit to get the Lettrine settings.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./chapters/chapter06}
\end{figure}

The number has been kerned using:

\begin{lstlisting}
 number before=\kern-4.5pt,
\end{lstlisting}

This template has a lot of potential and I will come back to it and add more key hooks for lettrine settings per letter and font management. They can also come alive with a gold color.
