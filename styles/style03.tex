\chapter{Introduction Style Three}

This is not an exact reproduction as I am still thinking as to how to use
specials with the package. You can vary it by setting the tcolorbox settings as well as the geometry settings.

\includegraphics[width=0.39\textwidth]{./chapters/chapter03}
\end{figure}

This setting involves changing the geometry of the page as well as adding the chapter name and title in a color box. For this I have used the \lstinline{tcolorbox}. Of course you can use any other shaded environment you feel comfortable with such as mdframed. It is important to set the colorbox parameters.

\begin{lstlisting}
\newgeometry{top=-10pt}
\tcbset{width=\paperwidth,boxrule=0pt,right=3cm,arc=0pt}
\end{lstlisting}

Note that we set the width of the \lstinline{tcolorbox} to \lstinline{\paperwidth} in order for the shading to extend to the full width of the page.
