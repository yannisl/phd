\chapter{INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER STYLE FORTY ONE}

\label{ch:41}
\epigraph{The existence of an area of free land, its continuous recession, and the advance of American
settlement westward explain American development.}{Frederick Jackson Turner, \textit{The Significance of the Frontier in American\\ History,} Columbian Exploration, Chicago, July 12, 1893}

A classical style chapter style with finely spaced out letters. A number of books spell out the chapter numbers. In general I find this as a good idea as sometimes the numbers don't blend in very well with the design.

This book has different chapters written by different authors and the author's name appear below an ornament. Don't dismiss ornaments as old fashioned as a lot of modern books still use them.

\begin{lstlisting}
\cxset{style41,
         chapter author=Yiannis Lazarides}
\end{lstlisting}

The ornaments I used was from the \texttt{fourier-orns} package. Here is a MWE if you want to experiment with various designs.


\begin{lstlisting}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fourier-orns}
\begin{document}

\section{THINGS THAT ARE NOT AUTOMATED}

If you need the title to be spaced out using the soul package and you have a line break, the package will issue the error `reconstruction failed'. In this case it is better to include the spaceout commands in the title (subject to hyperref not breaking up everything).


\begin{verbatim}
\chapter{\so{INTRODUCTION TO}\\ \so{CHAPTER STYLE FORTY ONE}}
