\chapter{Introduction to Style One}


\begin{summary}
This design is simple and its distinguishing characteristic is a short summary at the beginning of the chapter. This is almost like an abstract typeset in italic font without setting the margins in. We provide a \lstinline{summary} environment for convenience. Note the very simple line in the running head to the left of the page number.
\end{summary}
