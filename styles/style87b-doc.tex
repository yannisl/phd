\chapter{Summary MEP Progress Report for St Regis Hotel, Habtoor City}
\pagenumbering{arabic}
\thispagestyle{plain}
\section{Current Status}

We have started flushing of the Chilled Water system on the 7 April 2015, as planned and we anticipate to be in a position to progressively provide \emph{wild air} before the end of April, ahead of the scheduled date of the 7 May 2015. In the Basements and in the Guest rooms we have started final fix works, where possible. The Main Plantrooms at Technical Floors 1 and Podium 6, are in the main completed, except final ductwork connections where they impede access. BMS DDC Panels are expected to arrive by the 22 April 2015 and installation expected to be completed within 25-30 days to ensure that by end May we can provide controlled conditions.

Delays have been experienced in the receipt of Electrical panels, such as DBs (delayed due to late deliveries of components by Legrand) and others that were subjected to numerous changes, as described later on.  Other delays were due to late instructions as briefly detailed in Section~\ref{delays}. 

The current outstanding works for the St Regis Hotel are as follows:

\subsection{St Regis Basement}

\begin{description}
\item[Kitchen Corridors] Some kitchen corridors cable pulling is still under progress. Expected to complete by 30 Apr 2015.
\item[Main Electrical Room] Delays experienced due to the failure of cable trays during cable pulling and also due to the some of the MDBs being returned to the factory for modifications, as they failed QA/QC Inspections.
\item[Fan Rooms] Fans scheduled to be delivered 23 Apr 2015.
\item[BMS] DDC Panels still to be delivered.
\item[Sump Pumps] Expected to be delivered by 10 May 2015. 
\item[Others] There are still closure related works, for areas currently inaccessible, such as the new ramp areas, store and office areas. 
\end{description}

\subsection{Ground Floor}
\begin{description}
\item[Ballroom] This area is still under scaffolding being used by the Main Contractor to erect walk-ways in the ceiling. Once the scaffolding is dropped and we are given access to the lower level, we have to install another layer of services, give ceiling grid clearances and upon construction of the ceiling grid we can then install final sprinkler droppers and give clearances for final boarding.
\item[Banquet Hall] This area has been delayed due to the Iridium Spa delays in Design and appointment of subcontractors. As this area is above the Banquet Hall, coring for drainage pipes delayed the works. This coring is now complete and we expect to ask the Main Contractor to lower the scaffolding and start with the rest of the services.
\end{description}
\subsection{Mezzanine}
\begin{description}
\item[Festival Dining Restaurant] Currently this area is under nomination, there is no ID Design and final details are still awaited. 
\item[Security Room] The design for this room has recently changed. The room as shown in the new designs is different from what has been constructed on site and has no space for CCUs. 
\item[AV Room] Expected to be completed 30 Apr 2015.
\item[Furniture Store] Expected to be completed 25 Apr 2015.
\item[Balance Corridors] Expected to be completed 25 Apr 2015.
\end{description}

\subsection{Podium 1}

\begin{description}
\item[Banquet A/V Technician] We have no access. This is currently being used as a store.
\item[Service Corridor] Plan to release for ceiling grid on 23 Apr 2015.
\item[St Regis Main Kitchen and Corridor] Plan to release on 30 Apr 2015.
\item[Property Store] Currently no access. If access provided we can release by 30 Apr 2015.
\item[Steak House Kitchen] Plan to release by 30 Apr 2014.
\end{description}

\subsection{Podium 2}
\begin{description}
\item[Iridium Spa and related areas] We are currently working in the area, which was delayed by late appointment of Finishing Contractor. Still some ID Shop Drawings not available. We expect to catch-up with delays by end May 2015. We plan to complete final fix by 10 June 2015 and Testing and Commissioning by 20 Jul 2015.
\item[Other Areas] All other areas will be released for closure by 26 Apr 2015.
\end{description}

\subsection{Podium 3-6}

All guestrooms have been handed over for ceiling closures with the exception of some of the suites, where information and access was provided late. These are the following:

\begin{description}
\item[Ambassador Suite] Co-ordination ongoing. Expect resolution and final clearances 25 May 2015.
\item[Bentley Suite] Incomplete information. Completion targets uncertain at this stage.
\item[Royal Suite] Co-ordination on-going. Expect resolution and final clearances 25 May 2015.
\end{description}

\subsection{Floor 1}

\begin{description}
\item[Kitchen 4 and Kitchen 6] Works for walls are progressing, insufficient detail information. Can complete by 15 May 2015, provided all Kitchen Subcontactor’s drawings become available and unimpeded access.
\end{description}

\section{Delays in Target Dates}
\label{delays}
This is a brief summary of recent selected instructions for additional works that have impacted  MEP Progress. 
In addition to these additional works another critical factor that affected progress was the congestion of services and the numerous RFIs and responses we had to raise in order to resolve them.

\begin{itemize}
\item Relocation of Kitchen Extract ducting Ground Floor, Mezzanine and Podium BOH areas.
\item  Additional AV points in all public areas.
\item  Additional telephone, data and CCTV points in all Public Areas.
\item  Motorized curtains Meeting Rooms.
\item Lighting Control System. 
\item Emergency Lighting System. (see details Chapter~\ref{emergencylights})
\item Changes to Electrical DBs, SMDBs due to late receipt of DEWA approved drawings. (See Chapter~\ref{electrical})
\end{itemize}

We have reacted as fast as possible to all instructions and as soon they were received we have added resources to mitigate delays. Where days slipped these are only by a few days and we are confident that by end of this month all physical installations will be completed with the exception of the English Pub, Banquet and Royal Suite. 

\subsection{Back of the House Areas}

All back of the House Areas experienced delays, due to the lack of primary co-ordination at design stage. This caused delays until solutions were found enabling us to install the services. 

The allowable ceiling height in this area was impossible to be achieved and the kitchen extract duct eventually was split in two sections and distributed through two different routes in order to avoid passing it through the corridors which could not accomodate it.

In addition a new roller shutter window was introduced, that made it impossible to install the fresh air ducts feeding the kitchen. After several attempts by |K&A| to find an acceptable solution the roller shutter  window was abandoned as per the instructions of the Client Representative. 

\subsection{Basement Kitchen and Related Areas at B1}

Please note that these areas (with the exception of the corridor) have been cleared for ceiling grid closures in most areas and the balances are as per target to close by the 15 April 2015, including additional works. The additional works were mostly for additional ELV points on walls and for which we have received drawings on the 29 March 2015. We have instituted overtime and added additional crews to complete the works as fast as possible. Most rooms in the area have been affected.

\chapter{Busbar System}

As per the approved Baseline Program we expected to place the busbar order for all three hotels on 27 February 2014. However, HLS DSE-JV were unable to place any orders due to the events that are outlined below, with finality on all busbars only achieved in April 2015. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item On the 23 December 2013 we were requested to change the specification for some busbars via HLG transmittal Ref. No. HLG-626-DT-HLS-0628 dated 23 Decemeber 2013 \textit{Fire Resistance Bus Bar Specification}.

\item On the 25 February 2014 we were issued revised designs via tranmittal Ref. No. HLG-626-DT-HLS-0873 \textit{Revised Electrical Drawings}.

\end{enumerate}


\chapter{Generators}

\section{Generator Ventilation}

\subsection{Background}

The original tender drawings indicated the Generator Ventilation to be by means of Louvres. When such an approach is taken normally the ventilation openings are dictated by the size of the generators.


HLS DSE-JV have submitted as early as 2014 RFIs outlining concerns regarding the adequacy of the ventilation openings and sizing of Generator rooms in the basements.

On the 25 March 2015, we were instructed to proceed with the purchase of additional fans from Systemaire. We issued the order request on the ..... and the order placed on the ......  without formal approval of the amounts in order to speed up the purchase. This affected the commissioning of the generators.

\chapter{Emergency Lighting System}
\label{emergencylights}
The Emergency Lighting System was finalized on the 22 February 2015. This is impacting on the final fix and commissioning of the Hotel’s Central Battery and Emergency Lighting System. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item As per the approved Baseline Program, we were planning to submit the Material Submission of the Emergency Lighting System by the 25 Feb 2014.
\item On the 25 Nov 2013, we raised RFI \texttt{HLS-DSE/142 JV-RFI-MEP-E028} requesting full details of the Emergency Lights as well as the capacity of the central battery system in order to proceed with Technical Submittals, design of containment system and procurement of equipment.
\item On the 12 Dec 2013 we received an insufficient reply to the above mentioned RFI. We have notified you that the repsonse was insufficient via letter \texttt{HLS DSE/JV/HLG/YL1181} dated 14 Jan 2014, clearly stating that we were unable to proceed further with the submission of the Central Battery System, until the requested information was provided. In our letter we had requested that all details such as diffuser details, base type, IP rating and lamp characteristics are provided. We have also provided details as to Civil Defence requirements.
\item The above concerns were forwarded to the Engineer by the Main Contractor on the 20 Jan 2014. The Engineer instructed us to follow the current design dawings until the completion of the Lighting Consultant’s works.

\item On 10 Feb 2014, we had responded via letter \texttt{HLS-DSE/JVHLG/YL/1227} stating that the information provided by the Engineer, as response to RFI HLS-DSE/142 MEP-E028 was inadequate to produce Shop Drawings and to proceed with material procurement or calculations.
\item On 19 March 2014, once again we responded via letter HLS DSE/JV/626/2.05/YE/nd/2609/14 dated 4 Mar 2014 stating that the inforamtion was inadequate.
\item On 16 April 2014 we sent a clear notification that the lack of information was expected to delay the works via letter \texttt{HLS DSE/JV/HC/L/YL/1322} stating that we were unable to proceed with this portion of the works.

\item On the 20 August 2014 we received via an email instructions to proceed based on a generalized scheme.
\item We raised RFI-MEP-E249 dated 21 Sep 2014, requesting more details on locations and quantities of Emergency Light Fittings. The RFI response was received on 13 Oct 2014 with the response to follow the latest issued Guest Room drawings. 
\item Engineer’s letter \texttt{DU1211/DU/L20054/14} dated 15 Sep 2014, confirmed that due to several ID Design issues the above details were no longer applicable.
\item On 30 Sep 2014 we served notices regarding additional works due to revisions of the Emergency Lighting System for all three hotels.
\item On 15 Nov 2014, we raised concerns due to late finalization of the Central Battery System for W and Westin Hotels. 
\item On the 20 Dec 2014 the we received instructions from the Engineer and Client requesting us to revert back to the original K\&A designs.
\item On the 22 Feb 2015, the Engineer instructed us to procure and install all the Front of House exit lights. We confirmed receipt of the instruction via letter \texttt{YL/1935} dated 24 Mar 2014 once all final details and samples were finalized.
\end{enumerate}
