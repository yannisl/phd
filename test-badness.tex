In olden times when wishing
still helped one, there lived a
king whose daughters were all
beautiful, but the youngest was so
beautiful that the sun itself,
which has seen so much, was
astonished whenever it shone in
her face. Close by the king's
castle lay a great dark forest,
and under an old lime-tree in the
forest was a well, and when
the day was very warm, the
king's child went out into the 
forest and sat down by the side
of the cool fountain, and when she was bored she
took a golden ball, and threw it up on a high and caught it, and this
ball was her favorite plaything. \par
