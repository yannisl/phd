The population of Cambodia was estimated at 13.5 million in 2003
(Asian Development Bank, 2003~) Approximately 90 percent of Cambodians
are ethnic Khmer and speak Khmer as their native language. Khmer
belongs to the Mon-Khmer subfamily of the Austro-Asiatic language family;
Vietnamese (in the Vietnamese subfamily) is the only other national language
in this family. The Khmer alphabet began to develop in the seventh
century and influenced the later development of the Thai writing system,
though the two languages are not mutually comprehensible; Khmer itself
was influenced by Pali and Sanskrit, and modern Khmer contains many loan
words from these Indian languages (Diffloth, 1992; Thel, 1985; Weber,
1989). Minority populations in Cambodia include Cham, Chinese, and
Vietnamese, all of which number in the hundreds of thousands (Kosonen,
2004). Somewhat more than 100,000 Cambodians belong to around 30
indigenous ethnic groups living for the most part in the northeast highlands.
Members of the relatively isolated Brao, Jarai, Krung, Tampuan, and other
communities often do not speak Khmer (Thomas, 2002, 2003).

\begin{docKey}[phd]{khmer font}{=\meta{font name} (Khmer  UI)} {}
Loads the font
command \cmd{\khmer}. When the command is used it typesets text in
khmer unicode. There is no need to load the language, unless it is the main document language. For windows the default font is \texttt{DaunPenh} this font is in general too small to read; a better font to use is Khmer UI.

The Khmer script (Khmer: {\Large\khmertext{អក្សរខ្មែរ}}; IPA: [ʔaʔsɑː kʰmaːe]) [2] is an \textit{abugida} (alphasyllabary) script used to write the Khmer language (the official language of Cambodia). It is also used to write Pali among the Buddhist liturgy of Cambodia and Thailand.

It was adapted from the Pallava script, a variant of Grantha alphabet descended from the Brahmi script of India, which was used in southern India and South East Asia during the 5th and 6th Centuries AD.[3] The oldest dated inscription in Khmer was found at Angkor Borei District in Takéo Province south of Phnom Penh and dates from 611.[4] The modern Khmer script differs somewhat from precedent forms seen on the inscriptions of the ruins of Angkor.

Not all Khmer consonants can appear in syllable-final position. The most common syllable-final consonants include {\khmer កងញតនបមល}. The pronunciation of the consonant in final position may differ from it's normal pronunciation.

ុ	kbiĕh kraôm (ក្បៀសក្រោម)	also known as bŏkcheung (បុកជើង); used in place of the diacritics treisâpt and musĕkâtônd when they would be impeded by superscript vowels
