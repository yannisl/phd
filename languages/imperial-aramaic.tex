\label{s:imperialaramaic}

\subsection{History}

Aramaic is the best-attested and longest-attested
member of the NW Semitic subfamily of languages
(which also includes inter alia \nameref{s:hebrew}, \nameref{s:phoenician},
\nameref{s:ugaritic}, Moabite, Ammonite, and Edomite). The
relatively small proportion of the biblical text
preserved in an Aramaic original (Dan 2:4–7:28; Ezra
4:8–68 and 7:12–26; Jeremiah 10:11; Gen 31:47 [two
words] as well as isolated words and phrases in
Christian Scriptures) belies the importance of this
language for biblical studies and for religious studies
in general, for Aramaic was the primary international
language of literature and communication throughout
the Near East from ca. 600 B.C.E. to ca. 700 C.E. and
was the major spoken language of Palestine, Syria,
and Mesopotamia in the formative periods of
Christianity and rabbinic Judaism. 



Aramaic survived over a period of 3,000 years, during which time its grammar, vocabulary and usage experienced great changes. Aramaic scholars found it useful to divide the several Aramaic dialects into periods, groups and subgroups based both on the chronology as well as the geography.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Old Aramaic
\item Imperial Aramaic
\item  Middle Aramaic
\item Late Aramaic
\item Modern Aramaic
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Old Aramaic (to ca. 612 BCE)}
This period
witnessed the rise of the Arameans as a major force
in ANE history, the adoption of their language as an
international language of diplomacy in the latter days
of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and the dispersal of
Aramaic-speaking peoples from Egypt to Lower
Mesopotamia as a result of the Assyrian policies of
deportation. The scattered and generally brief
remains of inscriptions on imperishable materials
preserved from these times are enough to
demonstrate that an international standard dialect had
not yet been developed. The extant texts may be
grouped into several dialects:

\subsection{Middle Aramaic (to ca. 250 C.E.)}
In the Hellenistic and Roman periods, Greek replaced
Aramaic as the administrative language of the Near
East, while in the various Aramaic-speaking regions
the dialects began to develop independently of one
another. Written Aramaic, however, as is the case
with most written languages, by providing a
somewhat artificial, cross-dialectal uniformity,
continued to serve as a vehicle of communication
within and among the various groups. For this
purpose, the literary standard developed in the
previous period, Standard Literary Aramaic, was
used, but lexical and grammatical differences based
on the language(s) and dialect(s) of the local
population are always evident. It is helpful to divide
the texts surviving from this period into two major
categories: epigraphic and canonical.

\subsection{Late Aramaic (to ca. 1200 C.E.)}
The bulk of
our evidence for Aramaic comes from the vast
literature and occasional inscriptions of this period.
During the early centuries of this period Aramaic
dialects were still widely spoken. During the second
half of this period, however, Arabic had already
displaced Aramaic as the spoken language of much
of the population. Consequently, many of our texts
were composed and/or transmitted by persons whose
Aramaic dialect was only a learned language.
Although the dialects of this period were previously
divided into two branches (Eastern and Western), it
now seems best to think rather of three: Palestinian,
Syrian, and Babylonian.

The Aramaic alphabet is adapted from the \nameref{s:phoenician} alphabet and became distinctive from it by the 8th century BCE.  The letters all represent consonants, some of which are \emph{matres lectionis}, which also indicate long vowels.

\subsection{Modern Aramaic (to the present day)}

These dialects can be divided into the same three
geographic groups.

\begin{description}

\item[a. Western]
Here Aramaic is still spoken only in
the town of Ma’lula (ca. 30 miles NNE of Damascus)
and surrounding villages. The vocabulary is heavily
Arabized.

\item[b. Syrian]
Western Syrian (Turoyo) is the language
of Jacobite Christians in the region of Tur-Abdin in
SE Turkey. This dialect is the descendant of
something very like classical Syriac. Eastern Syrian
is spoken in the Kurdistani regions of Iraq, Iran,
Turkey, and Azerbaijan by Christians and, formerly,
by Jews. Substantial communities of the former are
now found in North America. The Jewish speakers
have mostly settled in Israel. These dialects are
widely spoken by their respective communities and
have been studied extensively during the past
century. It has become clear that they are not the
descendants of any known literary Aramaic dialect.

\item[c. Babylonian] 

Mandaic\ref{s:mandaic} is still used, at least until
recently, by some Mandaeans in southernmost Iraq
and adjacent areas in Iran.

In addition, in recent years classical \nameref{s:syriac} has
undergone somewhat of a revival as a learned vehicle
of communication for Syriac Christians, both in the
Middle East and among immigrant communities in
Europe and North America.

\subsection{Alphabet and typesetting}

The Aramaic alphabet is historically significant, since virtually all modern Middle Eastern writing systems can be traced back to it, as well as numerous non-Chinese writing systems of Central and East Asia. This is primarily due to the widespread usage of the Aramaic language as both a \emph{lingua franca} and the official language of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and its successor, the Achaemenid Empire. Among the scripts in modern use, the Hebrew alphabet bears the closest relation to the Imperial Aramaic script of the 5th century BC, with an identical letter inventory and, for the most part, nearly identical letter shapes.

Writing systems that indicate consonants but do not indicate most vowels (like the Aramaic one) or indicate them with added diacritical signs, have been called abjads by Peter T. Daniels to distinguish them from later alphabets, such as Greek, that represent vowels more systematically. This is to avoid the notion that a writing system that represents sounds must be either a syllabary or an alphabet, which implies that a system like Aramaic must be either a syllabary (as argued by Gelb) or an incomplete or deficient alphabet (as most other writers have said); rather, it is a different type.

The Imperial Aramaic alphabet was added to the Unicode Standard in October 2009 with the release of version 5.2.
The Unicode block for Imperial Aramaic is \unicodenumber{U+10840–U+1085F}.
