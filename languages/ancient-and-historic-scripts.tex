\chapter{Ancient and Historic Scripts}

Writing was perhaps the most important human invention. \tex authors and developers either due to need or fascination developed macros and fonts for many archaic writing systems. Many of these packages are now outdated, as the Unicode standard and the newer engines opened up a fascinating world. My own fascination with writing systems prompted me to add support for such scripts in the \pkgname{phd} package. The development to an extend was frustrating as the overloading of numerous fonts caused compilation to be very slow. Finding the right font was also problematic in many cases, as we opted to identify Open Source fonts. The \tex engine of preference is \luatex. To avoid loading too many fonts, unless they are required, we provide the keys:

\def\loadscripts{}
\cxset{scripts/.store in = \loadscripts}

\begin{key}{/phd/scripts = \meta{all, lineara, linearb, phaestos,\ldots}} The scripts key takes a list of options to enable or disable the loading of fonts and the usage of the key is explained later on. You set it with our only command |\cxset|\meta{key value list}
\end{key}

Supplementary keys, exist for each individual script enabling the setting of specific fonts to a particular script. However, if all the recommended fonts have been installed is quicker to use the |scripts| key.

\def\olmecfontstore{}

\cxset{olmec font/.store in=\olmecfontstore}

\cxset{olmec font=epiolmec}

\begin{key}{/phd/olmec font = \meta{font name}}
\end{key}

The key |script| can be used on its own. It will then load the default fonts built-in, in the |phd| package.

\cxset{script/.store in = \scripttempt}

\begin{key}{/phd/script = \meta{script name}}
\end{key}

The first attempt  at communication via writing was through ideographic or mnemonic symbols. Undoubtedly symbolic writing must have existed much earlier than the surviving artifacts, carved in woord or scribled on muddy walls. The earliest surviving symbolic writing are the Jiahu symbols. They were carved on tortoise shells in Jiahu, ca.~6600~BC. Jiahu was a neolithic Peligang culture site found in Henan, China. In Europe the Tărtăria tablets are three tablets, discovered in 1961 by archaeologist Nicolae Vlassa at a Neolithic site in the village of Tărtăria (about 30 km (19 mi) from Alba Iulia), in Romania.[1] The tablets, dated to around 5300 BC,[2] bear incised symbols - the Vinča symbols - and have been the subject of considerable controversy among archaeologists, some of whom claim that the symbols represent the earliest known form of writing in the world. The Indus script appeared ca. 3500 BC and the Nsibidi script of Nigeria, ca. before 500 AD. 

No type of writing system is superior or inferior to another, as the type is often dependent on the language they represent. For example, the syllabary works perfectly fine in Japanese because it can reproduce all Japanese words, but it wouldn't work with English because the English language has a lot of consonant clusters that a syllabary will have trouble to spell out. The pretense that the alphabet is more "efficient" is also flawed. Yes, the number of letters is smaller, but when you read a sentence in English, do you really spell individual letters to form a word? The answer is no. You scan the entire word as if it is a logogram.

And finally, writing system is not a marker of civilization. There are many major urban cultures in the world did not employ writing such as the Andean cultures (Moche, Chimu, Inca, etc), but that didn't prevent them from building impressive states and empires whose complexity rivals those in the Old World

Unicode encodes a number of ancient scripts, which have not been in normal use for a millennium or more, as well as historic scripts, whose usage ended in recent centuries. Although these scripts are no longer used to write living languages, documents and inscriptions using these languages exist, both for extinct languages and for precursors of modern languages. The primary user communities for these scripts are scholars, interested in studying the scripts and the languages written in them. A few, such as Coptic, also have contemporary liturgical or other special purposes. Some of the historic scripts are related to each other as well as to modern alphabets. The following are provides as of Unicode version~7.2.
