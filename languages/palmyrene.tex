Palmyrene is the very widely attested Aramaic dialect and script
of Palmyra in the Syrian desert. The texts date from the midfirst century to the destruction of Palmyra by the Romans in AD 272. Palmyra in the Roman period was a major trading centre.

The longest of the Palmyrene texts, is the bilingual  taxation tariff written for the year 137 AD in Palmyrene Aramaic and Greek.\footnote{For more details see:MILIK J.T., Dédicaces faites par des dieux (Palmyre, Hatra, 
Tyr) et de thiases sémitiques à l'époque romaine, Paris 1972; ROSENTHAL R., Die 
Sprache der palmyrenischen Inschriften, Leipzig 1936; STARK J.K., Personal Names in 
Palmyrene Inscriptions, Oxford 1971; DRIJVERS H.J.W., The Religion of Palmyra, 
Leiden 1976; TEIXIDOR J., 'Palmyre et son commerce d'Auguste à Caracalla', in 
Semitica 34, (1984) 1-127.  } Trade connections 
took the Palmyrene script to other places, some not far away, such as Dura Europos on the Euphrates, butothers at a great distance. A particular inscription is from South Shields, Roman Arbeia, in the north-east of England, carved on behalf of a Palmyrene mechant for his deceased wife and probably dating to the early third century AD. 

The Palmyrene script existed in two main varieties, a monumental and a cursive one, though the latter is little known and the evidence  mostly from Palmyra itself. The Syriac script of Edessa in southern Turkey, is often regarded as derived or closely related to the Palmyrene---similarities are found in the letters: ', b, g, d, w, h, y, k, l, m, n, `, r and t---though a strong case can also be made for connecting Syriac with a northern Mesopotamian script-family represented principally in texts from Hatra, a city more or less contemporary with Palmyra in Upper Mesopotamia.
