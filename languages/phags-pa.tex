The 'Phags-pa script, (Mongolian: дөрвөлжин үсэг "Square script") was an alphabet designed by the Tibetan monk and vice-king Drogön Chögyal Phags-pa for the Mongol Yuan emperor Kublai Khan as a unified script for the literary languages of the Yuan. 


It was first promulgated in 1269, although there is an inscription to testify its use before that time. ThePP alphabet is considered to have been designed for all the languages of the Mongol empire, but it appears it was almost used exclusively for Mongolian and Chinese. 

Widespread use was limited to about a hundred years during the Yuan Dynasty, and it fell out of use with the advent of the Ming dynasty. The documentation of its use provides clues about the changes in the varieties of Chinese, the Tibetic languages, Mongolian and other neighboring languages during the Yuan era.

After the fall of the Yuan dynasty in 1368, PP fell out of use, although it may have survived on seals and in some copybooks (although some hold that these descend froma Tibetan seal script rather than from PP).  

PP was based on the Tibetan alphabet and was used for writing both Chinese and Mongolian.

The script as a whole system comes down to us in two different traditions. On the one hand we have the letters and arrangements as they were recorded in the \textit{Shu shih hui yao} and the Fas shu k'ao, two 14th century works on calligraphy. Here the letters are presented in a more Buddist and Tibetan tradition.

Phags-pa is a historical script related to Tibetan that was created as the national script of
the Mongol empire. Even though Phags-pa was used mostly in Eastern and Central Asia for
writing text in the Mongolian and Chinese languages, it is discussed in this chapter because
of its close historical connection to the Tibetan script. The script has very limited modern use. It bears similarity to Tibetan and has no case distinctions. It is written vertically in columns running for left to right, like Mongolian. Units are often composed of several syllables and sometimes are separated by whitespace.
