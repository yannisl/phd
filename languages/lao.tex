The Lao alphabet, Akson Lao (Lao: \laotext{ອັກສອນລາວ} [ʔáksɔ̌ːn láːw]), is the main script used to write the Lao language and other minority languages in Laos. It is ultimately of Indic origin, the alphabet includes 27 consonants (\laotext{ພະຍັນຊະນະ} [pʰāɲánsānā]), 7 consonantal ligatures (\laotext{ພະຍັນຊະນະປະສົມ} [pʰāɲánsānā pá sǒm]), 33 vowels (\laotext{ສະຫລະ} [sálā]) (some based on combinations of symbols), and 4 tone marks (\laotext{ວັນນະຍຸດ} [ván nā ɲūt]). 



According to Article 89 of Amended Constitution of 2003 of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, the Lao alphabet is the official script to the official language, but is also used to transcribe minority languages in the country, but some minority language speakers continue to use their traditional writing systems while the Hmong have adopted the Roman Alphabet.[1] An older version of the script was also used by the ethnic Lao of Thailand's Isan region, who make up a third of Thailand's population, before Isan was incorporated into Siam, until its use was banned and supplemented with the very similar Thai alphabet in 1871, although the region remained distant culturally and politically until further government campaigns and integration into the Thai state (Thaification) were imposed in the 20th century.[2] The letters of the Lao Alphabet are very similar to the Thai alphabet, which has the same roots. They differ in the fact, that in Thai there are still more letters to write one sound and the more circular style of writing in Lao.

Lao, like most indic scripts, is traditionally written from left to right. Traditionally considered an \emph{abugida} script, where certain 'implied' vowels are unwritten, recent spelling reforms make this definition somewhat problematic, as all vowel sounds today are marked with diacritics when written according the Lao PDR's propagated and promoted spelling standard. However most Lao outside of Laos, and many inside Laos, continue to write according to former spelling standards, which continues the use of the implied vowel maintaining the Lao script's status as an \emph{abugida}. Vowels can be written above, below, in front of, or behind consonants, with some vowel combinations written before, over and after. Spaces for separating words and punctuations were traditionally not used, but a space is used and functions in place of a comma or period. The letters have no \emph{majuscule} or \emph{minuscule} (upper and lower case) differentiations

The Unicode block for the Lao script is U+0E80–U+0EFF, added in Unicode version 1.0. The first 10 characters of the row U+0EDx are the Lao numerals 0 through 9. Throughout the chart grey (unassigned) code points are shown, because the assigned Lao characters intentionally match the relative positions of the corresponding Thai characters. This has created the anomaly that the Lao letter \laotext{ສ} is not in alphabetical order, since it occupies the same codepoint as the Thai letter \laotext{ส}.
