\chapter{Middle Eastern Scripts}
\label{ch:middleeasternscripts}

The scripts in this section have a common origin in the ancient phoenician (\S~\ref{s:phoenician}) alphabet. They include:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\nameref{hebrew} & \nameref{s:samaritan}\\
Arabic & Thaana\\
\nameref{s:syriac} &\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The Hebrew script is used in Israel and for languages of the Diaspora. The Arabic script is
used to write many languages throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and certain parts
of Asia. The Syriac script is used to write a number of Middle Eastern languages. These
three also function as major liturgical scripts, used worldwide by various religious groups.

The Samaritan script is used in small communities in Israel and the Palestinian Territories
to write the Samaritan Hebrew and Samaritan Aramaic languages. The Thaana script is
used to write Dhivehi, the language of the Republic of Maldives, an island nation in the
middle of the Indian Ocean. 

Text in these scripts is written from right to left. Arabic and Syriac are cursive scripts even when typeset, unlike Hebrew, Samaritan  and Thaana, where letters are unconnected. Most letters in Arabic and Syriac assume different forms depending on their position in a word. Shaping rules are not required for Hebrew because only five letters have position-dependent forms, and these forms are separately encoded.

Historically, Middle Eastern  scripts did not write short vowels. In modern scripts they are represented  by marks positioned above or below a consonantal letter. Vowels and other
marks of pronunciation (``vocalization’’) are encoded as combining characters, so support
for vocalized text necessitates use of composed character sequences. Yiddish, Syriac, and
Thaana are normally written with vocalization; Hebrew, Samaritan, and Arabic are usually written unvocalized.
