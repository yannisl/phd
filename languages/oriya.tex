\epigraph{Oṛiyā is encumbered with the drawback of an excessively awkward and cumbrous written character. ... At first glance, an Oṛiyā book seems to be all curves, and it takes a second look to notice that there is something inside each.}{(G. A. Grierson, \textit{Linguistic Survey of India}, 1903)}

The Oriya script or Utkala Lipi (Oriya: \oriyatext{ଉତ୍କଳ ଲିପି}) or Utkalakshara (Oriya: \oriyatext{ଉତ୍କଳାକ୍ଷର}) is used to write the Oriya language, and can be used for several other Indian languages, for example, Sanskrit.

Comparison of Oṛiyā script with its neighbours

At a first look the great number of signs with round shapes suggests a closer relation to the southern neighbour Telugu than to the other neighbours Bengali in the north and Devanāgarī in the west. The reason for the round shapes in Oriya and Telugu (and also in Kannaḍa and Malayāḷam) is the former method of writing using a stylus to scratch the signs into a palm leaf. These tools do not allow for horizontal strokes because that would damage the leaf.

Oriya letters are mostly round shaped whereas in Devanāgarī and Bengali have horizontal lines. So in most cases the reader of Oṛiyā will find the distinctive parts of a letter only below the hoop. Considering this the  closer relation to Devanāgarī and Bengali exists than to any southern script, though both northern and southern scripts have the same origin, Brāhmī.

Oriya (\oriyatext{ଓଡ଼ିଆ} oṛiā), officially spelled Odia,[3][4] is an Indian language belonging to the Indo-Aryan branch of the Indo-European language family. It is the predominant language of the Indian states of Odisha, where native speakers comprise 80\% of the population,[5] and it is spoken in parts of West Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh. Oriya is one of the many official languages in India; it is the official language of Odisha and the second official language of Jharkhand. [6][7][8] Oriya is the sixth Indian language to be designated a Classical Language in India, on the basis of having a long literary history and not having borrowed extensively from other languages.
