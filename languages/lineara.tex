We are fortunate that the frescoes that survived on the walls of the palaces and building at Knossos and other places give us a view of the material culture of the Minoans. These have been studied extensively. Cameron's\footcite{Cameron1976} thesis reviewed the development of the murals beginning with  Neolithic architectural muse of mud plasters, the first painted plasters occuring in EM II settlements and simple decorative schemes in the First Palaces (1900-1700 B.C.). The sudden rise of pictorial naturalism in MM IIIA is explained by native cultural developments of the First Palace Period, not by foreign influences or \enquote{eideticism}  which he rejects convincingly altogether.

A review of the motival repertory leads to considerations of six main \enquote{cycles of ideas} whence the painters derived their themes. The most important, confined to Knossos palace, depicts a major festival of grand processions and athletic activities before the chief Minoan goddess, and it illuminates the palatial architechural design. But five different systems of mural decoration characterise Minoan architecture as a whole, with regional and perhaps autonomous variations at Cycladic sites. Technical considerations confirm \enquote{buon fresco} as the normal painting technique and distinguish Knossian town house and palace murals in construction and purpose. Similar distinctions in compositional design are also described. A review of eleven \enquote{schools} of Knossian painters and of regional artists precedes a detailed reconstruction of the dates of the frescoes on stratigraphical, stylistic and comparative evidence. Cameron suggests that Sir Arthur Evans's fresco dating should generally be lowered by one Minoan phase. Minoan pictorial painting ceases with the palace destruction at Knossos, c.1375 B.C. Major differences appear between pre- and post-LM IB frescoes, tentatively explained on the evidence of Aegean and Egyption pictorial representations by the arrival at Knossos of a Mycenaean military dynasty, c.1450 B.C. Minoan wall painting finally disappeared in the LM IIIB period.

Many early societies used tatoos to decorate the body. Glotz\footcite{Glotz2003} thought the some women had tatoos on their body and faces and offered the example of the . Later this form of painting disappeared. The Cretan woman was always depicted elegantly. Tattooing, which is universally practised by primitive
communities, and is perpetuated by the primitive menlbers
of advanced communities, was known among all the Neolithic
populations of the \Ae gean. Crete was no exception. At
Phaistos a figurine of a steatopygous woman is marked with
a little cross on one side. In the metal age the custom
survived in the Cyclades and in Argolis, where faces are often
marked with horizontal lines of red dots, with vertical or
oblique lines, or with circles of dots around a central point.

In the tombs, within reach of the dead, were
placed the tools and vessels required for this ritual operation,
such as needles or awls, vases containing red or blue pigment,
and palettes. But in Crete there is no trace of tattooing
after the Stone Age. Certain small vases, discovered in
Cretan tombs and houses, and mistaken for paint pots, were
really receptacles for offerings.1 The very most that may
be supposed is that the Cretans placed a stigma upon the faces
of their slaves . This would explain the fact that the CupBearer,
a brachycephalic type, has a blue mark carefully
painted on his temple (Fig. 53) , though it is probable that
he is a foreigner bringing tribute. This haste to get rid of
marks disfiguring the face is an early sign of the aesthetic
sense.

The scripts during the Aegean Bronze Age form and independent group distinct from the
contemporary Egyptian and Babylonian systems.\footcite{packard1974}\textsuperscript{,}\footcite{booktabs} Four major branches are attested during the
second millenium: the Cretan Hieroglyphic script, Linear A, Linear B, and Cypro-Minoan.  By the end of the Broze Age this family of scripts had fallen out of use, and Greece remained illiterate until the introduction of the Phoeneician script centuries later. A single descendant of the earlier Aegean scripts survived in the first millenium on the island of Cyprus in the form of the Cypriot Syllabary.\footnote{test}\footnote{testing} \label{s:lineara}\index{scripts>Linear A}

The Greeks had evidently already occupied the mainland and islands of the
Ægean, including Crete, by the middle of the third millennium
BC. Around 2000 BC, following their consolidation of power on
Crete, new wealth from trade with cosmopolitan Canaan
allowed the creation of a complex palace economy, with major
centres at Knossos, Phaistos and other Cretan sites – Europe’s
first high civilization, the Minoan. Trade with Canaan had evidently
also brought Greeks into contact with Byblos’ pictorial
syllabic writing, whose underlying principle the Minoans borrowed.
Now, Cretans could also write their Minoan Greek language
using a small corpus of syllabo-logographic signs
representing \textit{in-di-vi-du-al} syllables. The signs themselves and
their phonetic values – nearly all V (e) or CV (te) – were wholly
indigenous: what the rebus signs, all originating from the
Cretan world, depicted, one pronounced in Minoan Greek, not
in a Semitic language. (Minoan Greek appears to have been an
archaic sister tongue of the mainland’s Mycenæan Greek.\footnote{A History of Writing. })

Three separate but related forms of syllabo-logographic
writing emerged in the Ægean between c. 2000 and 1200 BC: the
Minoan Greeks’ ‘hieroglyphic’ script and Linear A, and the
later Mycenæan Greeks’ Linear B. Minoan Greeks apparently
also took their writing at an early date to Cyprus, where it experienced
two stages: Cypro-Minoan (evidently derived from
Linear A is one of two currently undeciphered writing systems used in ancient Greece. Cretan hieroglyphic is the other. Linear A was the primary script used in palace and religious writings of the Minoan civilization. It was discovered by archaeologist Arthur Evans. It is the origin of the Linear B script, which was later used by the Mycenaean civilization.

Linear A and its daughter Linear C, the ‘Cypriote Syllabic
Script’. All Ægean and Cypriote scripts are clearly syllabologographic,
as the objective identity of each rebus sign would
have been immediately recognizable to each learner and user. It
seems that determinatives were never employed in any of the
Ægean or Cypriote scripts; however, logograms additionally
depicted most spelt-out items on accounting tablets. All Ægean
and Cypriote scripts, but for these separate logograms, were
completely phonetic.

\subsection{Cretan Hieroglyphic}

Crete’s \enquote{hieroglyphic} script is the patriarch of this robust
family, its inspiration perhaps derived from Byblos via Cyprus.\footfullcite{packard1974}
As its name implies, this script used pictorial signs to reproduce the syllabic inventory of the Minoan
Greek language, here used in rebus fashion as at Byblos. This
writing occurs on seal stones (and their clay impressions), baked
clay, and metal and stone objects, most of these discovered at
Knossos and dating from 2000– 1400 BC (the script was concurrent
with Linear A). There exist about 140 different signs in all –
that is, 70 to 80 syllabic signs and their alloglyphs (different signs
with the same sound value), as well as logograms: human figures,
parts of the body, flora, fauna, boats and geometrical shapes.
Writing direction was open: from left to right, from right to left,
with every other line reversed, even spiral. That this script also
included logograms and numerals suggests that it was initially
used for book-keeping, among other things, until its replacement
in this function with its simplification, Linear A. Thereafter, like
Anatolian hieroglyphs, the Cretan hieroglyphic script appears to
have assumed a ceremonial role in Minoan Greek society,
reserved for sacred inscriptions, dedications and royal proclamations
on round clay disks.



In the 1950s, Linear B was largely undeciphered and found to encode an early form of Greek. Although the two systems share many symbols, this did not lead to a subsequent decipherment of Linear A. Using the values associated with Linear B in Linear A mainly produces unintelligible words. If it uses the same or similar syllabic values as Linear B, then its underlying language appears unrelated to any known language. This has been dubbed the Minoan language.\footnote{\url{http://www.people.ku.edu/~jyounger/LinearA/LinAIdeograms/}}

Many of the characters form group and specialists name them such as vases in transliterations.

Linear A contains more than 90 signs (open vowels and consonants+vowels) in regular use and a host of
logograms, many of which are ligatured with syllabograms and/or fractions; about 80\% of these
logograms do not appear in Linear B. While many of Linear A’s signs are also found in Linear B, some
signs are unique to A (e.g., A *301 and following), while some signs found in Linear B are not yet found
in Linear A (e.g., B 12, 14-15, 18-19, 25, 32-33, 36, 42-43, 52, 62-64, 68, 71-72, 75, 83-84, 89-91).

The Unicode Linear A encoding is broadly based on the GORILA ([{\arial ɡɔɹɪˈlɑː}]) catalogue
(Godart and Olivier 1976–1985)\parencite{gorila}, which is the basic set of characters used in decipherment efforts.However, “ligatures” which consist of simple horizontal juxtapositions are not uniquely encoded here, as
these may be composed of their constituent parts. On the other hand, “ligatures” which consist of stacked
or touching elements have been encoded.\footnote{An online resource for ancient writing systems in the mediterranean\protect\url{http://lila.sns.it/mnamon/index.php?page=Risorse&id=19&lang=en}. }
