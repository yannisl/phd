Syriac /ˈsɪriæk/ ({\syriac{ܠܫܢܐ ܣܘܪܝܝܐ}} Leššānā Suryāyā) is a dialect of Middle Aramaic that was once spoken across much of the Fertile Crescent and Eastern Arabia.[1][2][5] Having first appeared as a script in the 1st century AD after being spoken as an unwritten language for five centuries,[6] Classical Syriac became a major literary language throughout the Middle East from the 4th to the 8th centuries,[7] the classical language of Edessa, preserved in a large body of Syriac literature.
It became the vehicle of Syriac Christianity and culture, spreading throughout Asia as far as the Indian Malabar Coast and Eastern China,[8] and was the medium of communication and cultural dissemination for Arabs and, to a lesser extent, Persians. Primarily a Christian medium of expression, Syriac had a fundamental cultural and literary influence on the development of Arabic,[9] which largely replaced it towards the 14th century.[3] Syriac remains the liturgical language of Syriac Christianity.
Syriac is a Middle Aramaic language, and, as such, it is a language of the Northwestern branch of the Semitic family. It is written in the Syriac alphabet, a derivation of the Aramaic alphabet.
