\chapter{European Alphabetic Scripts}

\section{Introduction}

Modern European alphabetic scripts are derived from or influenced by the Greek script,
which itself was an adaptation of the Phoenician alphabet. A Greek innovation was writing
the letters from left to right, which is the writing direction for all the scripts derived from or
inspired by Greek

The European alphabetic scripts and additional characters described in this chapter follow the Unicode blocks:

\section{Latin Script}
\label{s:latin}
Latin script, or Roman script, is an alphabet based on the letters of the classical Latin alphabet. It is used as the standard method of writing in most Western and Central European languages, as well as many languages from other parts of the world. Latin script is the basis for the largest number of alphabets of any writing system[1] and is the most widely adopted writing system in the world (commonly used by about 70\% of world's population). It is also the basis of the International Phonetic Alphabet. The 26 most widespread letters are the letters contained in the ISO basic Latin alphabet.

The script is either called Roman script or Latin script, in reference to its origin in ancient Rome. In the context of transliteration the term "romanization" or "romanisation" is often found.[2][3] Unicode uses the term "Latin"[4] as does the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).[5] The numerals are called Roman numerals.


\subsection{Ligatures}

Ligatures for the Latin script are found in the Unicode block Alphabetic Presentation Forms which contains standard ligatures for the Latin, Armenian, and Hebrew scripts.
