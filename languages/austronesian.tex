The Austronesian language family is the largest and most widespread in the
world, with somewhere around 700 (maybe as many as 1,200) languages\footfullcite{adelaar2005}
altogether and 300 million native speakers.\footnote{Ethnologue lists 1,268
Austronesian languages, making it the second largest language family in the world.}
Aside from Southeast Asia, Austronesian languages are found on numerous islands in the eastern and
central Pacific Ocean all the way to Easter Island. There is also a western
outpost language (Malagasy), spoken on the island of Madagascar. The news of the missing Malaysia Airlines debri found in
Madagasgar, gives credence to theories that Austronesian had a foothold by canoes from Indonesia getting lost in a storm and ending up there.\footnote{Cover image shows The Ifugao tribe, one of many mountain tribes in Luzon, has an impressive
farming practice that uses terraces of irrigated fields to grow rice. Members

In Southeast Asia the major languages in this family are Indonesian
(Bahasa Indonesia) and Malaysian (Bahasa Melayu), collectively referred
to as Malay (200 million speakers, about 40 million as a first language),
Javanese (75 million speakers), Sundanese (30 million), and Filipino
(Tagalog) (50 million, 17 million as a first language). There are hundreds of
other, closely related languages in Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.
All the native languages of these countries are Austronesian except for the
Aslian languages of interior Malaysia. There are also some Austronesian
pockets in southern Vietnam and Cambodia, such as the Chamic languages
(Thomas 1998; Grant and Sidwell Forthcoming). Estimates of the number
of Austronesian languages vary a lot, mainly because of difficulties in
drawing the \enquote{language/dialect} distinction.

The Austronesian languages of insular and peninsular Southeast Asia all
belong to the western division of Austronesian. This is usually regarded
as consisting of two further groups, the Central Malayo-Polynesian branch
(in the Moluccas and Lesser Sunda islands, about 100–150 languages) and
the much larger Western Malayo-Polynesian branch (which includes Malay
and the Philippine languages). Another group of about ten Austronesian
languages, in a distantly related subgroup, is located on the island of Formosa
(Taiwan). These languages have about 400,000 speakers.

Table \ref{tbl:mainlanguages} from Robert Blust's book \textit{The Austronesian languages}\footfullcite{robert2009} lists the national languages covered by AN.

Austronesian languages tend to have phoneme inventories which are
medium to small in size. They have abundant morphology,
using affixes of all kinds (prefixes, suffixes, infixes, circumfixes) and
reduplication to build up complex words from simpler ones (see section
3.2.5). All of these languages have an inclusive/exclusive distinction in plural
pronouns, i.e. there are two words for ‘we’—one including the addressee
and one excluding the addressee. This is a feature shared by no other language
family in Southeast Asia or East Asia.

On the western side of insular
Southeast Asia most Austronesian languages have intricate systems of voice
or focus marking (see section 4.4), and many are verb-initial, including Toba
Batak, \hyperref[s:tagalog]{Tagalog}, Chamorro, and the Formosan languages. In the centre and
eastern side of the region, closer to Papua, voice systems are either much
more restricted or lacking altogether, verb-medial constituent order is
common, and subjects and objects are often expressed by pronominal clitics
(Klamer 2000; Grimes 2000).
