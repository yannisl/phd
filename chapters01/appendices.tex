\chapter{STYLING APPENDICES}

\section{Appendix section}

As far as LaTeX is concerned, there is nothing special in styling an appendix. It is either a chapter or a section with a different name. This name in order to allow internationalization is called \lstinline{appendixname}.
\bigskip

\begin{tcolorbox}[width=\linewidth]
\begin{lstlisting}
\newcommand\appendix{\par
  \setcounter{chapter}{0}%
  \setcounter{section}{0}%
  \gdef\@chapapp{\appendixname}(*@\footnote{The actual literal used for   \textbackslash{appendixname} is defined later on, so that you can customize the language}\label{appendixname}@*)
  \gdef\thechapter{\@Alph\c@chapter}
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{tcolorbox}
\medskip

The code above is only a simplified version of the command. One might need to add more formatting information such as resetting equation numbers, tables and figures and any special floating environments that have their own numbering.

\begin{tcolorbox}[width=\linewidth]
\begin{lstlisting}
\renewcommand\appendix{\par
                \stepcounter{chapter}
                \setcounter{chapter}{0}
                \stepcounter{section}
                \setcounter{section}{0}
                \setcounter{equation}{0}
                \setcounter{figure}{0}
                \setcounter{table}{0}
                \setcounter{footnote}{0}
  \def\@chapapp{\appendixname}%
  \renewcommand\thechapter{\@Alph\c@chapter}}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{tcolorbox}


\section{Usage}

With the \lstinline{classx} package appendices are formatted as chapters.

\begin{tcolorbox}[width=\linewidth]
\begin{lstlisting}
\appendix
\cxset{numbering=Alpha}
\chapter{STYLING APPENDICES}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Enhancements}
More enhancements are possible. For one we can get rid of the chapter, which semantically is not very good, one should have followed a similar style to that of the sections and the \lstinline!\appendix{Title}!. I am not sure if this wouldn't be a bit confusing to people.

\subsubsection{Appendices at end of chapters}
Some styles require appendices to be set at the end of each chapter. These type of appendices can also be added. However an appendix counter might need to be defined.

\paragraph{test paragraph}

\subparagraph{test subparagraph}


%\setstyle{13}
\cxset{numbering=Alpha, name=Appendix}
\@specialfalse%required to negate effect of special tikz picture.
