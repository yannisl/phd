% \section{Introduction}
% 
% \LaTeX2e, does not provide a standard library, but comes equipped with
% a packagee mechanism that allows code extensions to be loaded as required.
% This has created a strong vibrant community, hundreds of packages and a 
% headache to both new and seasoned users. What packages are available, when
% to use them and in which order is a common theme for many questions on
% lists and |TX.SE|.

% It is quite common during the writing of a thesis or book
% for the author to keep on adding macros and packages
% at the preamble of the document. In most cases this can
% be satisfactory but in many others it leads to
% incompatibilities and errors. This package aims at
% minimizing one's preamble, by prefetching a number of
% commonly used packages. It also aims at loading them
% in the right order and providing patches for conflicts.
% 
% I am hoping that using this package, will lead to less
% frustrations with the intricacies of \LaTeX2e\ packages.
%
% Although I expect most users to just load the package, using
% the standard command:
%
% \begin{teX}
%  \usepackage{phd}
% \end{teX}
% it will be better for the longer projects to just fork the
% package and adapt it to your needs. In this respect, I have
% uploaded the package to |github|.
% 
% Most of the documentation can be found in the implementation part.
%
% 
% \section{Ordering of Packages}
% 
% One package that normally leads to errors is the 
% |hyperref|. As a lot of internal commands of the kernel
% and of some packages it has to be loaded at the end
% of the preable with the exception of some packages! 
% 
% This manual is typeset according to the conventions of the
% \LaTeX \textsc{docstrip} utility which enables the automatic
% extraction of the \LaTeX{} macro source files~\cite{GOOSSENS94}.
%
% 
% \href{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/96350/problem-with-algorithmic-and-hyperref}{problem with algorithmic and hyperref}
% \begin{verbatim}
%\usepackage{float}  % load float package first!
%
%\usepackage{hyperref} % let hyperref patch the float package stuff
%.
% \usepackage{algorithm} % let algorithm use the patched version of the float package
% \end{verbatim}
% \section{Conventions}
% \subsection{Defining Colors}
% All color definitions are of the form |the<color>|. So the setting for |theblue| is called
% |theblue|. This provides easy to remember commands.
% 
% \section{Document Structure}
% We do not load too many packages for document structure, a these are expected to be
% treated at class level.
% \begin{table}[ht]
% \centering
% \caption{Packages used for structure.}
% \begin{tabular}{ll}
%   \toprule
%   Package  & Default\\
%   \midrule
%   |multicol| & called by author  \\
%   \bottomrule
% \end{tabular}
% \end{table}
% \section{Use of boxes}
% You can use the |tcolorbox| package to create nicely formatted boxes for examples.
%\newcounter{texercise}[section]
%\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5,colframe=blue!50!black,arc=1mm,
%                          theorem={Equations}{texercise}{More on summation}{myMarker}]{}{}
%\medskip
%
%\begin{tabular}{lr@{~}c@{~}l@{\qquad}r}
%\multicolumn{5}{l}{\hspace{-2ex}\textbf{Line Values.}} \\
%\multicolumn{5}{r}{}\\
%\multicolumn{4}{l}{Altitude of triangle on side $a$,} \\
%& $h$ &=& \( \displaystyle \frac{2}{a}
%             \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} \) & \\

%\multicolumn{4}{l}{Median of triangle on side $a$,} \\
%& $m$ &=& \( \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{2(b^2+c^2) - a^2} \) & \ \\
%\multicolumn{5}{l}{\hspace{-2ex}\textbf{Areas.}} \\
%Rectangle,      & $S$ &=& $b\times h$ &  \\
%Square,         & $S$ &=& $b^2$        &  \\
%\end{tabular}
%\end{tcolorbox}

% \section{Version control with Git and Github}
% If you are involved with code or a publication that will have frequent changes, you should consider
% some type of version control system. My own recommendation is to use |git| and an online repository such
% as |github|. The latter is currently very fashionable and makes sharing code easier. Note that the |github|
% offers both public as well as private repositories. The general recommendation is that for unpublished work
% such as a thesis or code under development, it is preferable to go for a private repository. 
% 
% \subsection*{What is the difference between Git and GitHub?}
%git is a version control, system think of it as a series of snapshots (commits) of your code. You see 
%a path of this snapshots, in which order they where created. You can make branches to experiment and come back to snapshots you took.
%GitHub, is a web-page on which you can publish your git repositories and collaborate with other people.
%
% \subsection*{Is git saving every repository locally (in the user's machine) and in GitHub?}
%
% No, it's only local. You can decide to push (publish) some branches on GitHub.
%
% \subsection*{Can you use Git without GitHub? If yes, what would be the benefit for using GitHub?}
%
% Yes, it runs local. You could back it up with dropbox. See also \href{http://dotmonster.co/backup-and-sync-folders-with-dropbox-and-symbolic-links/}{how to sync your git folders to dropbox}.
%
%\subsection*{How does Git compare to a backup system such as Time Machine?}
%
%It's a different thing, git lets you track changes and your development process. If you use git with GitHub, it becomes effectively a backup. However usually you would not push all the time to GitHub, at which point you do not have a full backup if things go wrong. I use git in a folder that is synchronized with dropbox.
%
% To synchronize the two, you create a symlink in your Git folder, i.e., in your repository. This can even be done in windows although it is normally called a \textit{short-cut}. Write click in the folder and create a short-cut to the drop-box folder. For example if you create a folder \texttt{pic} to hold your pictures, this folder will be automatically uploaded at \texttt{dropbox}. You don't want your pictures tracked at Github, as they do not really need version control. Do not forget to exclude them by typing in the \texttt{.gitignore} file the directive  \verb|*.lnk|.
%
%\subsection*{Is this a manual process, in other words if you don't commit you wont have a new version of the changes made?}
%
%Yes, commiting and pushing are both manual.
%
%\subsection*{If are not collaborating and you are already using a backup system why would you use Git?}
%
% You program worked. You developed more, your program does not work. git diff, shows you the difference between the current code and the last working commit.
%
% Or you just go back to the last working. You want to try a change, but are not sure it really will work. 
% You create a branch, test you code change. If it works fine, you merge it to the main branch. If it does not you throw the branch away and go back to the main branch.
% You did some debugging. Before you commit you always look at the changes from the last commit. You see your debug print statement that you forgot to delete.
%
%Make sure you check gitimmersion.com.

% \section{Implementation}
%
%    Standard file identification. We first announce the package and require that it be used with LaTeX2e. 
%    \begin{macrocode}
\NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}% LaTeX 2.09 can't be used (nor non-LaTeX)
[1994/12/01]% LaTeX date must be December 1994 or later
\ProvidesPackage{phd}[2013/2/26 v1.0 less preamble (YL)]
%    \end{macrocode}
% 
% \section{Package Management} 
%  
% In order to keep track of all the packages and keys we require a
% number of macros will be defined first.
% 
% Each of the packages used by this document is loaded conditionally.
% However, it might be nice to know if we have a complete set.  So we
% define |\ifcomplete| which starts true, but gets set to false if any
% package is missing. Some code is necessary in order to manage 
% the complexity.
% I am idebted to the source of |symbols.tex| for some of the macros.
% There are a number of symbols (e.g., \cmd{\Square}) that are defined by      
% multiple packages.  In order to typeset all the variants in this       
% document, we have to give glyph a unique name.  To do that, we define  
% \cmd{\savesymbol{XXX}}, which renames a symbol from \cmd{\XXX} to \cmd{\origXXX}, and    
% \cmd{\restoresymbols{yyy}{XXX}}, which renames \cmd{\origXXX} back to \cmd{\XXX} and     
% defines a new command, |\yyyXXX|, which corresponds to the most recently 
% loaded version of |\XXX|.                                                
%                                                                        
% This implementation of \savesymbol and \restoresymbol was copied from  
% the |savesym| package, which started with symbol.tex's old definitions   
% of those macros and improved upon them.  However, \renamerobustsymbol  
% and |\ifnotsavedsym| are new to this set.                                
%

%    \end{macrocode}
% Test if a symbol is not saved.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\ifnotsavedsym@helper#1#2!{\expandafter\ifx\csname orig#2\endcsname\relax}

% 
%    \begin{macrocode}

%    \end{macrocode}
%    
% |\IfStyFileExists*| is just like |\IfFileExists|, except that it appends
% ".sty" to its first argument.  |\IfStyFileExists| is the same as
% |\IfStyFileExists*|, but it additionally adds its first argument to a list
% (|\missingpkgs|) and marks the document as incomplete (with
% |\completefalse|) if the |.sty| file doesn't exist.
% 
% \begin{macro}{\missingpkgs}
% \begin{macro}{\foundpkgs}
%   \begin{macrocode}
\newcommand{\missingpkgs}{}
\newcommand{\foundpkgs}{}
\newcommand{\if@sty@file@exists@star}[3]{%
  \ifloadpackages

%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \end{macro}



% \subsection{Utility macros for displaying symbols and fonts}
%
% In the sections that follow, we use a number of utilities for
% displaying fonts and utilities in tables and figures, we collect
% them here and make them available to the user for document
% use.
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
% From stmarysrd symbols package
% A very convenient command to typeset symbols.
% Much preferable than tables. Slight modifications to
% make it a bit more clear
\def\symbols{\flushleft}
\def\endsymbols{\endflushleft}
\def\dosymbol#1{%
   \leavevmode\hbox to .33\textwidth{%
    \hbox to 1.2em%
    {\hss$#1$\hfil}%
   \footnotesize\texttt{\string#1}\hss}%
   \penalty10}
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% \symbols
% \dosymbol{\Square} \dosymbol{\square} \dosymbol{\Diamond} \dosymbol{\diamond} \(\dosymbol{\symbol{60}}\)
% \endsymbols
%   
% \section{Best practices} 
% 
% We load a few packages for fixes and errors and |nag| if outdated packages are used.
% Modify to suit your requirements.  
% Package management is a bit complex to avoid errors
% with options.
%To find out if a package has already been loaded, use
%|\@ifpackageloaded|\meta{package}\meta{true}\meta{false}.
%|\@ifpackagelater| To find out if a package has already been loaded with a version more recent
%|\@ifclasslater| than version, use |\@ifpackagelater|\meta{hpackagei}\meta{hversioni}\meta{true}\meta{hfalsei}.
%|\@ifpackagewith| To find out if a package has already been loaded with at least the options
%hoptionsi, use |\@ifpackagewith|\meta{hpackagei}\meta{hoptionsi}\meta{htruei}\meta{hfalsei}. 
%There exists one package that can't be tested with the above commands: the
%fontenc package pretends that it was never loaded to allow for repeated reloading
%with different options (see ltoutenc.dtx for details).
%
% \subsection{Best Practices}
% 
% We include the following two packages to provide the standard fixes
% for \LaTeX2e\ and the |nag| package to provide some guidance as to good
% practices. We set the |nag| keys to |orthodox| and |l2tabu.|
% \url{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/19264/techniques-and-packages-to-keep-up-with-good-practices?rq=1}
% and \href{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/193298/best-practices-in-latex}{best practices in LaTeX.}
%    \begin{macrocode}
\RequirePackage{fixltx2e}                % LaTeX2e fixes
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% We load pgfkeys for key management.
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\RequirePackage{pgf,pgfkeys}               % before onlyasmath
\newcommand\cxset{\pgfqkeys{/phd }} %Notice this is pgf q keys
%
%
\cxset{nag keys/.store in =\nagkeys@cx,

%        
%
\cxset{nag keys = {l2tabu,%
                   orthodox,%
                   %
                  }}
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% For |xcolor| we try and load as many pre-defined colornames as
% possible.


%    \begin{macrocode}
\cxset{xcolor keys={fixpdftex,xtable,usenames,dvipsnames,svgnames,x11names}}

%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\PassOptionsToPackage{\nagkeys@cx}{nag}
\RequirePackage{nag}   
%    \end{macrocode}
%

%
% \begin{macro}{onlyasmath}
% The package |onlyasmath| also provides errors for deprecated math
% commands like using |$$|\ldots|$$| which can result in unwanted spaces
% being introduced in the typsetting of the document. The recommended 
% way is to use |\[|\ldots|\]|. The package was developed by Harold Harders
% and although targetted for class writers one might as well use it directly.
% 
%    \begin{macrocode}

\PassOptionsToPackage{\onlyamsmathkeys@cx}{onlyamsmath}
\RequirePackage{onlyamsmath} 
\RequirePackage{microtype}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
%
% I prefer to issue an error rather than a warning to instill good
% practices early during document processing.
% 
% 
% \subsection{Graphics}
% 
% We load the package |graphicx| with no options. We let |graphicx|, to 
% handle any draft options via the class itself. We load the package |caption|
% for any captions outside floats. (Needs checking where to place).
% \href{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/3131/graphicspath-for-miktex}{graphicspath for MikTeX} check
% adds figures etc to paths. We add some common paths. If you call your image
% folders |image| or |graphics| you don't need to do anything else.
% 
%    \begin{macrocode}
\RequirePackage{graphicx}
\setkeys{Gin}{width=\linewidth,totalheight=\textheight,keepaspectratio}
\graphicspath{{graphics/}{graphics//}{images//}{./graphics/}{../graphics/}{./pic/}{../pic}}
\usepackage{wrapfig}
%    \end{macrocode} 
%
% \begin{macro}{rotating}
% The package performs
% most sorts of rotation one might like, including rotation of complete floating
% figures and tables. The package was developed by Robin Fairbairns
% Sebastian Rahtz and Leonor Barroca. We use the option |quiet| as the 
% package is rather verbose.
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\RequirePackage[quiet]{rotating}
%    \end{macrocode} 
% \end{macro}
% 
% \section{Color Management}
%
% Most classes load the |xcolor| package, including
% it here, should either be able to check if it was 
% loaded by the class or to pass the options before
% the class itself. This package is a common source
% of errors, as classes load it with mostly different options.
% Because of this is also a good example to test our code
% in a number of minimal working examples.
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\@ifpackageloaded{xcolor}{}%

% \section{Lipsum}
%
% In publishing and graphic design, lorem ipsum is placeholder text (filler text) commonly used to demonstrate the graphics elements of a document or visual presentation, such as font, typography, and layout, by removing the distraction of meaningful content. The lorem ipsum text is typically a section of a Latin text by Cicero with words altered, added and removed that make it nonsensical in meaning and not proper Latin. Other packages exist such as |kantlipsum| and |blindtext|, however,
%both result in somewhat legible texts, which defeats the purpose of providing texts that the reader is not going to read. the extensions |lipsumx| aim at
%providing a gap between the three packages. It provides extensions
% for full document testing.

%    \begin{macrocode}
\newif\ifLIPSUM
\RequirePackage{lipsum}
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% \section{Tables}
% 
% \begin{macro}{\inc}
% \begin{macro}{\resetinc}
%
% It is highly unlikely that a publication, would not have a table
% somewhere, to make life easier we load Simon Fear's |booktabs|. The manual is a must
% read if you want to typeset typographically attractive tables.\footnote{Notice I haven't said
% typographically correct, there is no such thing.} We don't need to set any keys for the
% package.
%

%    \begin{macrocode}
\RequirePackage{booktabs}
\newcounter{step}
\def\resetinc{\setcounter{step}{0}}
\def\inc{\stepcounter{step}\thestep}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \end{macro}
%
% \begin{macro}{tabularx}
% David Carlisle's package enables the typesetting of fixed width tables and can stretch
% specific columns. The package loads the |array| package, but we save it from some
% trouble by pre-loading it first, so we can capture its loading. The package has two keys
% |infoshow| and |debugshow| which we don't bother at this stage to load.
% 
%    \begin{macrocode}
\RequirePackage{tabularx}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}

% \begin{macro}{delarray}
% The addition to array.sty added in delarray.sty is a system of implicit |\left|
%|\right| pairs. If you want an array surrounded by parentheses, you can enter:
%|\begin{array}({cc}) . .|
% 
%    \begin{macrocode}
\RequirePackage{delarray}
\RequirePackage{array}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}

%\[
%A=\begin{array}({cc})
%	a & b\\
%	c & d
%\end{array}
%\]

% \begin{macro}{dcolumn}
% The |dcolumn| package also by David Carlisle is loaded next. This package 
% defines a system for defining columns of entries in an |array|
% or tabular which are to be aligned on a `decimal point'. It also loads the |array|
% package, which we have already loaded.
% 
%    \begin{macrocode}
\RequirePackage{dcolumn}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
%
% \begin{macro}{longtable}
% 
% Perhaps the |longtable| package, needs no introduction. It has some
% peculiar settings and sometimes a couple of runs before it settles
% down. The package has four keys |errorshow|, |pausing|, |set| and |final| looks 
% as if they deprecated, at this stage we make onlty a mental note of it.
% The package cannot be used within |multicolumn| environments and will
% emit an error. 
% 
%    \begin{macrocode}
\RequirePackage{longtable}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}   


% \begin{macro}{multirow}
% 
% The |multirow| by Piet van Oostrum and its two companion packages
% |bigdelim| and |bigstrut| can be used to define multirow cells. They are difficult
% to get right and in most instances one can redesign the tables better without
% resorting to multi-rows. It has a strange interaction with the |colortbl|
% and a hack around its usage which we will load next.
% 
%    \begin{macrocode}
\RequirePackage{colortbl}
\RequirePackage{multirow}

%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% 
% \begin{macro}{threeparttable}
% This package by Donal Arsenau facilitates tables with titles (captions) and notes. The
% package comes with a number of options |para|, |flushleft|, online and normal.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\RequirePackage{threeparttable}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
%
%  {\begin{center}
%
%  \begin{threeparttable}[b]
%    \caption{...}
%  \begin{tabular}{ll} 
%   \toprule
%    one cell 42\tnote{1}&\\
%    another cell \tnote[2]&\\
%  \bottomrule
%  \end{tabular}
%  \begin{tablenotes}
%    \item [1] the first note ...
%    \item [2] the second note
%  \end{tablenotes}
%  \end{threeparttable}
%  \end{center}}
%  
% \section{Landscape Pages}
%
% A common request from authors is to rotate text, tables and or
% figures and to typeset the content using a landscape page.
%
% \begin{macro}{landscape}
% \begin{macro}{lscape}
% This package by Heiko Oberdiek Package |pdflscape| adds PDF support 
% to the environment landscape 
% of  package |lscape| by setting the PDF page attribute /Rotate. 
% It has to be loaded after |lscape|.
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\RequirePackage{pdflscape}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \end{macro}
%  

% \section{Maths}
%
% Although we cognisant that there are documents that do not use math
% and perhaps others that our selection of packages is inadequate, we
% offer a bundle of what we think will cover most of the cases. One
% issue with maths is that we are limited with TeX's built-in math
% alphabet limitations.
% 
% \begin{macro}{mathtools} We start with |mathtools|\ctan{mathtools}, as it loads the
% |amsmath| package and can also pass options to it. The package was developed 
% by LarsMadsen and is maintained by Will Robertson and Joseph Wright. It
% appears to be very popular with a lot of scholars in the sciences and
% mathematical fields and hence I decided to  include it here.
% 
%    \begin{macrocode}
\RequirePackage[allowspaces]{empheq} %defines harpoon macros
\PassOptionsToPackage{leqno}{mathtools}
\RequirePackage{mathtools}
\RequirePackage{nicefrac}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
%
% Many of the tools shown in this manual can be turned on and off by 
% setting a switch to
% either true or false. In all cases it is done with the command 
% |\mathtoolsset|. A typical
%  use could be something like
% \begin{equation}
%  a=c+d
% \end{equation}
%
% This provides a useful way to hook into the package options
% using our setting interface.
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cxset{tag left bracket/.store in = \leftbracket@cx,
       tag right bracket/.store in = \rightbracket@cx,
       tag font-weight/.store in = \tagfontweight@cx,
       mathtool center colon/.store in=\centeredcolon@cx}
%
\cxset{tag left bracket =[,
       tag right bracket =],
       tag font-weight=\textbf,
       mathtool center colon=false}

% \section{Special Symbols}
%
% The next section of the package, deals exclusively for packages that
% handle symbols. The best guide to such symbols is 
% \textit{The Comprehensive LaTeX Symbols Guide}. One needs to distinguish
% a number of different types of symbols required for a manual and it is
% a difficult exercise to make a selection. Another issue with symbols
% is that there is a bit of overlap between the various fonts and commands
% as to be expected.

%\subsection{Symbols in textcomp}
%, has numerous symbols \ldots
% We use the \pkg{texcomp} package for special symbols, such as |\checkmark|
%  \( \mho \Diamond \leadsto \rhd \diamond \Diamond \). The sort of the standard package
% latexsym is not loaded as it duplicates functionality of the if one makes use of the packages |amsfonts| or |amssymb|.
%

% \begin{macro}{textcomp} 
% \begin{macro}{mathcomp} The package |textcomp| is part of the \LaTeX2e
% distribution. The description of the package
% on ctan can give the erroneous idea that it is obsolotet, on the contracry % is part of the original distribution.textcomp is not obsolete, it's just not distributed as extra package any more since it's distributed with the basic LaTeX. The mathcomp package defines macros for using some of these text... symbols with math and the abbreviation tc...


%

%  The symbols are used by calling them by their name. E.g. \textleaf:
%  \verb|\textleaf|.
%  
%  In mathematics the package \verb|mathcomp| works. Then the prefix
%  \verb|text| is replaced by \verb|tc|, for \emph{t}ext\emph{c}omp:
%  |tcohm|  \( \tcohm \)
% 
% The |mathcomp| package takes one option to describe the
% font to be used. We use |rmdfault| as teh option to default to
% the \cs{rmdefault} font.
% 
%    \begin{macrocode}
\RequirePackage{textcomp}

% \begin{macro}{exscale}
%This pack­age im­ple­ments scal­ing of the math ex­ten­sion font cmex.

Ad­di­tion­ally cmex vari­ants for the sizes 7pt to 9pt are nec­es­sary. Th­ese fonts are part of the AMS font pack­age.
%This pack­age is part of Stan­dard LATEX.

% Most authors that use LaTeX2e develop shorthands for common tasks such as, typing
% |See figure~\ref{fig:myplot}|. The advantage of a macro is that one can be consistent
% with capitalization or abbreviations.
% At first I thought of providing two macros for example \cs{sref} and \cs{Sref}, however
% the problem with such an approach is internationalization. If we allow the user to
% load her language then we need to pick-up the name from the \LaTeX2e\ definitions. There
% is also the additional issue that for paragraphs and sections, sometimes people prefer
% using an abbreviation. So we stay with lowercase commands and rather set the names using
% keys in the style settings file.

%\subsection{meta}\label{meta}
% This has been lifted from |doc|
% \begin{macro}{\meta}
% \changes{v1.4t}{1989/04/24}{Macro added.}
% \changes{v1.5w}{1990/02/03}{Breaks at space allowed.}
% \changes{v1.6a}{1990/05/24}{Extra space bug corrected.}
%    The |\meta| macro is a bit tricky. We want to allow line
%    breaks at blanks in the argument but we don't want a break
%    in between. In the past this was done by defining |\meta| in a way that a
%    \verb*+ + is active when the argument is scanned. Words are then
%    scanned into |\hbox|es. The active \verb*+ + will end the
%    preceding |\hbox| add an ordinary space and open a new
%    |\hbox|. In this way breaks are only possible at spaces.  The
%    disadvantage of this method was that |\meta| was neither robust
%    nor could it be |\protect|ed. The new implementation  fixes this
%    problem by defining |\meta| in a radically different way: we
%    prevent hypenation by defining a |\language| which has no
%    patterns associated with it and use this to typeset the words
%    within the angle brackets. see \sref{meta}
% \changes{v2.0i}{2000/05/21}{New implementation (pr/3170)}

%    
%    \begin{macrocode}
\DeclareRobustCommand\meta[1]{%
%    \end{macrocode}
%    Since the old implementation of |\meta| could be used in math we
%    better ensure that this is possible with the new one as
%    well. So we use |\ensuremath| around |\langle| and
%    |\rangle|. However this is not enough: if |\meta@font@select|
%    below expands to |\itshape| it will fail if used in math
%    mode. For this reason we hide the whole thing inside an
%    |\nfss@text| box in that case.

%    Need to keep track of what we changed just in case the user
