\section{What is LuaTeX}

Although \tex and \latexe can be used to program complex commands, and the proof is this book, they are not  general programming languages. Many tasks that can easily be carried out
in other programming languages, are extrememely complicated or very slow when done with \tex. Due to this limitation many auxiliary programs have been developed to assist in common tasks, such as |bibtex| or |biber| that are used to build bibliographies and |makeindex| or |xindy| to generate indexes. In both cases, sorting a list alphabetically is a relatively easy task, but very complicated using \tex.


Another limitation is \tex's math capabilities. One can just marvel at the efforts of \tex macro authors in achieving what they have achieved. A cursory look at the code in the \pkgname{fp} package \footfullcite{fp} can give you an idea of the difficulties and complexities involved. The similarly named package by the \latex3 Team is another gigantic and amazing production.

To address the need to do more complex functions within \TeX, an extension of \TeX{} called Lua\TeX{} started a few years ago.  
(The leaders of the project and main developers are Taco Hoekwater, Hartmut Henkel and Hans Hagen.) The idea was to enhance \TeX{} with a previously existing general purpose programming language. After a careful evaluation of possible candidates, the language chosen was Lua (see \href{http://www.lua.org/}{lua.org}), a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language that has,  of course, a free license suitable to be used with \TeX. It is a pity that at the time |Go| was not available, as it would have been a perfect languge to interface with \tex and perhaps eventually rre-write the original program into a new language.

Lua is considered an easy to learn and use language. Anyone with basic programming skills can use it without difficulty. (Many examples of Lua code can be found in this book, and also in \href{http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Lua}{rosettacode.com},
and \url{http://lua-users.org/}).

Lua\TeX{} is not \TeX{}, but an extension of \TeX{}, in the same way that pdf\TeX{} or \XeTeX{} are also extensions.
In fact, Lua\TeX{} includes pdf\TeX{} (it is an extension of pdf\TeX{}, and offers backward compatibility), 
and also has many of the features of \XeTeX.

Lua\TeX{} is now in a beta stage, but the current versions are usable (the first public beta was launched in 2007,
and when this paper was written on \today, the release used was version 1.\the\luatexversion). 

\section{Is LuaTeX for you?}

The choice of TeX engine should in a way be immaterial to you, if you are just thinking about typesetting normal books. If you are writing a thesis or you are involved with a longer and more complex document, \lualatex might be for you. 

\section{Embedding Lua in a TeX document}

Short Lua code can be embedded in a document fairly easily with 
\begin{docCommand}{directlua}{\marg{code}}
Although it is recommended to put Lua code in Lua files, from time to time one may want or need to go Lua in the middle of a document. To this end, LuaTeX has two commands: \cmd{\directlua} and \cmd{\latelua}. They work the same, except \cmd{\latelua} is processed when the page where it appears is shipped out, whereas \cmd{\directlua} is processed at once; the distinction is immaterial here, and what is said of \cmd{\directlua} also applies to \cmd{\latelua}.
\end{docCommand}

\section{From Lua to TeX}

There are a number of commands that can be used to pass code and values from Tex to Lua and vice-versa.

\begin{docCommand}{tex.print}{\meta{material}}
\end{docCommand}

Inside Lua code, one can pass strings to be processed by \TeX\ with the functions |tex.print()|, |tex.sprint()| and |tex.tprint()|. All such calls are processed at the end of a \refCom{directlua} call, even though they might happen in the middle of the code. This behavior is worth noting because it might be surprising in some cases, although it is generally harmless.

The function can also can also take an optional number as its first argument; it is interpreted as referring to a catcode table (as defined by \docAuxCommand{initcatcodetable} and \docAuxCommand{savecatcodetable}), and each line is processed by TeX with that catcode regime. For instance (note that with such a minimal catcode table, braces don't even have their usual values):

\begin{texexample}{catcodes}{lua:catcodes}
\directlua {tex.enableprimitives('',tex.extraprimitives()) }
\bgroup
\initcatcodetable1
\catcode`\_=0
\savecatcodetable1
\egroup
\directlua{tex.print(1, "_TeX")}
\luadirect{tex.print(1, "_TeX")}
\end{texexample}

The string will be read with |_| as an escape character, and thus interpreted as the command commonly known as |\TeX|. The catcode regime holds only for the strings passed to |tex.print()| and the rest of the document isn't affected.

If the optional number is -1, or points to an invalid (i.e. undefined) catcode table, then the strings are processed with the current catcodes, as if there was no optional argument. If it is -2, then the strings are read as if the result of \cmd{\detokenize}: all characters have catcode 12 (i.e. `other', characters that have no function beside representing themselves), except space, which has catcode 10 (as usual).


Note the |\directlua {tex.enableprimitives('',tex.extraprimitives()) }|, without this directive the extra primitives are not loaded, and the example will produce errors. this is rather hidden in the documention in version 0.\the\luatexversion running under \formatname.


\section{Checking for LuaTeX}

The first thing you will need to program, when developing a \luatex\ package, is to check that the engine is in fact using \luatex. This can be done using the \cs{ifluatex} from the package \pkgname{ifluatex}. 

\begin{texexample}{Checking for Lua}{}

\section{Getting started}

For an introduction to the most important gotchas of \docAuxCommand{directlua}, see the guide \texttt{lualatex-doc.pdf}, which is available at ctan or possibly in your distribution.

Before presenting the tools in this package, let me insist that the best way to manage a nontrivial piece of Lua code is preferable to use an external file and source it from Lua, as explained in the cited document.

\LuaTeX communicates with TeX with only a few commands. We will explore these commands first.

\subsection{Basic print statements}

\begin{teXXX}
\directlua{tex.print}
\end{teXXX}

To print you can use the Lua command \lstinline{tex.print}.

The package \pkg{luacode}\cite{luacode} provides some further environments and commands catering for
variations in catcodes. 



The |\directlua| is useful to call functions that have been defined using Lua.

\begin{texexample}{luacode}{ex:luacode}
\begin{luacode}
function LineBreaks(T1,T2)
 local a = T1 .. "\\\\" .. T2 .. "\\par" -- T1\\\\T2\\par
 local b = [[ T1\\T2 ]]                  -- "T1"\\\\"T2"
 local c = T1 .. "\\newline " .. T2      -- T1\\newline T2
 local d = [[ T1\string\newline T2 ]]    -- "T1"\\newline "T2"
 tex.print(a,b,c,d)
 end
\end{luacode}

\def\testlinebreaks#1#2{%
\bgroup\parindent=0pt
    \directlua{LineBreaks("#1","#2")}%
\egroup}
\testlinebreaks{one}{two}
\testlinebreaks{three}{four}
\end{texexample}

The code in the example ensures that the code is escaped properly firstly for \tex as it will try and expand the
strings and then also not to allow any strings that need escaping in Lua. This is a double edge sword that caught me a number of times.


Lua can handle subtraction, negative numbers, numbers with decimal points, multiplication (using *),
division (using /), exponentiation (using \texttt{\^} ), and combinations of these. Here are some examples:
\emphasis{directlua, tex,print}


\subsection{Scientific notation}

You can also write numbers using the \textit{scientific notation}, where the aprt before the upper multiplied by 10 to the power after $\textup{e}$

\begin{texexample}{Numbers scientific notation}{ex:scientific}

Some big numbers \directlua{tex.print(1.2193263111264E17 / 987654321)}

\end{texexample}


\section{Hexadecimal numbers}
Lua also understands hexadecimal (base 16) numbers, using the letters
a-f (or A-F) to represent 10 through 15. Hexadecimal numbers should start with \texttt{0x} or \texttt{0X}.

\begin{texexample}{Hexadecimal numbers}{ex:hex}
\directlua{tex.print(0XA)}
\end{texexample}


\section{Lua variables}
Lua variables are similar to those used by other computer languages, such as Python, Javascript and similar modern languages. They are untyped, which means they can easily produce subtle errors.

\begin{texexample}{Lua Variables}{}
\luadirect{
  A = 2^0.5
  B = 42 
 local  pi = 3.141617
 tex.print(A+B-pi)
}
\end{texexample}

Variables unless they are preceded with a |local| are in the document global space. We can continue our example from above as we did not define A and B again, they are available in the next example.

\begin{texexample}{Lua Variables}{}
\luadirect{
   tex.print(A+B)
   
   local A,B = 1,1
   tex.print(A+B) 
}
\end{texexample}

\begin{texexample}{Lua Variables}{}
\luadirect{
   tex.print(A+B)
   
   local A,B = 1,1
   tex.print(A+B) 
}

\def\abadd#1#2{%
  \luadirect{
     A = #1 + #2
     tex.print(A)}
}

\abadd{100}{925.56}
\end{texexample}



Lua is case sensitive, which means |NUM|, |Num| and |num| are different variables.

\begin{texexample}{Lua Variables case sensitivity}{}
\directlua{
   NUM=1
   Num=2 
   num=3
   tex.print(NUM+Num+num)
}
\end{texexample}


\subsection{Multiple Assignment}

You can assign multiple values to multiple variables at the same time. You can also print multiple values
at the same time. The comma is used for both. Here's how you use the comma for multiple assignment, and for printing multiple values at the same time:

\begin{texexample}{Another example}{}
\directlua{
  Product, Exponent = 10*10, 999
  A,B=1,2
  tex.print(Product, Exponent)
  tex.print(A,B)
}
\directlua{
    A,B=1,2
    tex.sprint("A=" .. A, "B =" .. B)
}
\end{texexample}





\section{Conditionals}
\begin{texexample}{Conditionals}{ex:conditionals}
\directlua{
 a=3
 b=12^2
 if a<b then 
   tex.sprint("$a<b^2$ "..a..", "..b) 
 else
 end
}
\end{texexample}

To test whether a variable is not |nil| in a conditional, it is terser to just write the variable name rather than explicitly compare against |nil|. Lua treats |nil| and |false| as |false| (and all other values as |true|) in a conditional:

\begin{texcode}{Idiomatic Lua conditionals}{ex:lua-condinional}
local line = io.read()
if line then  -- instead of line ~= nil
  ...
end
...
if not line then  -- instead of line == nil
  ...
end
\end{texcode}

However, if the variable tested can ever contain false as well, then you will need to be explicit if the two conditions must be differentiated: line == nil v.s. line == false.

and and or may be used for terser code:

\begin{texexample}{idiomatic Lua conditionals}{ex:cond}
\luadirect{
local function test(x)
  x = x or "idunno"
    -- rather than if x == false or x == nil then x = "idunno" end
  tex.print("YES!")
    -- rather than if x == "yes" then tex.print("YES!") else tex.print(x) end
end
  test()
}
\end{texexample}


\subsection{while loop}

\begin{texexample}{while loop}{ex:loop}
\directlua{
   counter = 1
   while counter <= 100 do
      tex.print(counter)
   counter = counter + 1
   end
}
\end{texexample}

\let\exec\directlua
\subsection{for loop}
\begin{texexample}{for loop}{ex:forloop}
\exec{
for N = 1, 10 do
 tex.print(N)
 end
}
\end{texexample}

\subsection{repeat until}
\let\exec\directlua
\begin{texexample}{repeat until}{ex:repeat}
\exec{
  N,Z=1,21
  F=1
  repeat
    tex.print(N+Z)
    N=N+1
    F=F+10
  until F>=99
  tex.print(Z)
}
\end{texexample}

\subsection{The break and do Statements}
\begin{texexample}{Break and do}{ex:breakanddo}
\exec{
for N = 1, 10 do
 if N > 5 then
 break
 end
 tex.print(N)
 end
}
\end{texexample}

\chapter{Functions}

\cxset{epigraph width=0.6\textwidth,
       epigraph text align=left}
\epigraph{“A computer is like a violin. You can imagine a novice trying fist a phonograph and then a violin. The latter, he says, sounds terrible. That is the argument we have heard from our humanists and most of our computer scientists. Computer programs are good, they say, for particular purposes, but they aren't flexible. Neither is a violin, or a typewriter, until you learn how to use it.” }{Marvin Minsky}

\section{What are functions}

The main mechanism for abstraction of statements and expressions in Lua are \textit{functions}. Function carry out specific tasks. In other languages sometimes they are called a \textit{procedure} or a \textit{subroutine}. Functions are first class citizens in Lua. They can be used both as statements or as expressions.

\begin{texexample}{Functions used in expressions}{ex:expressions}
\begin{luacode}
  a = math.sin(2) + math.cos(10)
  tex.print(a)
\end{luacode}
\end{texexample}

The arguments are enclosed in parentheses denoting a call. If the function does not have any arguments, we must still call it with an empty list () to denote the call.

\section{Fixed Parameters}

The default convention for passing parameters to a function is using fixed parameters. These tell
the function how many parameters there will be and the order of the parameters. When using fixed
parameters , you know what to expect from the function, and based on the values of the parameters
passed, you can take appropriate action.

\begin{texexample}{An example}{}
\begin{luacode}
print=tex.print
function listParams(one, two, three)
print( "We got :", one, two, three)
if one=="Q" then
  tex.print("\\textls{The letter Q}")
else
  tex.print("Other letter")
end
end
listParams("Q", "Q", "R")
\end{luacode}
\end{texexample}


\section{Multiple Results}

An unconventional, feature of Lua is that functions can return multiple results. Many predefined functions in Lua return multiple values. 

Example \ref{ex:functions} has two parameters and returns the average of these numbers.

\begin{texexample}{Functions}{ex:functions}
\exec{
function Average(Num1, Num2)
    return (Num1 + Num2) / 2
end
tex.print(Average(10,12))
}
\end{texexample}

Here is one that prints the Ackerman function. This is an interesting function as the value grows very quickly and can cause a stack overflow. It can also slow compilation quite a bit for higher values. ack(4,1) will cause a stack overflow. Whereas ack(3,11) compiles giving a value of 16381 ack(3,12) causes a stack overflow.  

\[
\begin{matrix}
   a\uparrow\uparrow b & = {\ ^{b}a}  = & \underbrace{a^{a^{{}^{.\,^{.\,^{.\,^a}}}}}} & 
   = & \underbrace{a\uparrow (a\uparrow(\dots\uparrow a))} 
\\  
    & & b\mbox{ copies of }a
    & & b\mbox{ copies of }a
  \end{matrix}
\]

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
   a\times b & = & \underbrace{a+a+\dots+a} \\
   & & b\mbox{ copies of }a
\end{bmatrix} 
\]


\begin{texexample}{The ackerman function}{ex:ackerman}
\exec{
function ack(M,N)
    if M == 0 then return N + 1 end
    if N == 0 then return ack(M-1,1) end
    return ack(M-1,ack(M, N-1))
end
tex.sprint(ack(3,8))
}
\end{texexample}


\subsection{Returning multiple values}

This return an error if Arg1 is a number

\begin{texexample}{Return multiple arguments}{ex:multargs}
\exec{
function ReturnArgs(Arg1, Arg2, Arg3)
  return Arg1, Arg2, Arg3
end
tex.sprint(ReturnArgs("aaaa", 2, 3))
   
function Fact(N)
  local Ret = 1
  for I = 1, N do
    Ret = Ret * I
  end
  return Ret
  end
tex.print(Fact(10))
}
\end{texexample}


\begin{texexample}{Factorial}{ex:luafac}
\exec{
function Fact(N)
  local Ret = 1
  for I = 1, N do
    Ret = Ret * I
  end
  return Ret
  end
tex.print(Fact(10))
}
\end{texexample}

\subsection{Anonymous Functions}

Anonymous functions do not have a function name and can be assigned to a variable. 

\begin{texexample}{Anonymous Functions}{ex:anonymous}
\exec{
(function(A, B)
   tex.print(A + B^2)
 end)(2, 3)
}
\end{texexample}

\chapter{Working with Lua Tables}

This section explores a new data type called a table. It's a data structure, which means that it lets
you combine other values. Because of its flexibility, it is Lua’s only data structure. (It is possible to
create other, special-purpose data structures in C.)
\begin{phdverbatim}
\begin{filecontents*}{test.lua}
  hash = {}
  hash[ "key-1" ] = "val1"
  hash[ "key-2" ] = 1
  hash[ "key-3" ] = {}
  tex.sprint(hash["key-2"])
\end{filecontents*}
\directlua{dofile("test.lua")}
\end{phdverbatim}


\section{Using dofile}

Although using \lstinline{directlua} has been a useful function so far, this is limiting in many respects.

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{filecontents*}{test.lua}
 function test(N)
  return N
end
tex.print(test(5))
\end{filecontents*}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{texexample}{Working with lua file}{ex:dofile}
 function test(N)
   return N
 end
 tex.print(test(5))
\end{texexample}

As we want to keep ourselves within a document, rather than a separate file, we
use the \verb+filecontents+ package to save a lua file on disc and then use it with
\lstinline{dofile}.

\begin{phdverbatim}
\begin{filecontents*}{test.lua}
hash = {}
hash[ "key-1" ] = "val1"
hash[ "key-2" ] = 1
hash[ "key-3" ] = {}
hash[" key-3"] = {}
\end{filecontents*}
\directlua{dofile("test.lua")}
\end{phdverbatim}

The keys can include spaces. If you have to automate the key generation, ensure that the keys are trimmed.

\directlua{dofile("test.lua")}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\begin{filecontents*}{test.lua}
%Squares = {} -- A table constructor can be empty.
% for I = 1, 5 do
%   Squares[I] = I ^ 2
% end
% for I = 1, 5 do
%   tex.sprint(I .. " squared is " .. Squares[I].."\\\\")
% end
%\end{filecontents*}
%\directlua{dofile("test.lua")}
%\end{tcblisting}
%
%
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\begin{filecontents*}{test01.lua}
% NameToInstr = {John = "rhythm guitar",
% Paul = "bass guitar",
% George = "lead guitar",
% Ringo = "drumkit"}
% for Name, Instr in ipairs(NameToInstr) do
%   tex.sprint(Name)
% end
%\end{filecontents*}
%\directlua{dofile("test01.lua")}
%\end{tcblisting}


Using tables that contain functions is a handy way to organize functions, and Lua keeps many of its
built-in functions in tables, indexed by strings. For example, the table found in the global variable table
contains functions useful for working with tables. If you assign another value to table, or to one of the
other global variables used to store built-in functions, the functions won’t be available anymore unless
you put them somewhere else beforehand. If you do this accidentally, just restart the interpreter

\chapter{Packages}
The \pkg{luacode} package provides commands to make entering of code from a \TeX
file easier. It provides a better escape mechanism

\emphasis{luaexec,luacode}
\begin{texexample}{luaexec}{ex:exec}
\def\foo{156789.0001}
\(
 \luaexec{
 texio.write_nl("Special chars: _ ^ & $ { } ~ working.\string\n"
 .. "Backslashes still need a bit of care.\string\n"
 .. "Single sharps are easier now: \#")
  % a tex comment: we also get a % below
 tex.sprint("\\pi \\neq ", tostring(math.pi):gsub('\%.', '+'))
 % we can use TeX macros
tex.sprint("-", math.sqrt(\foo))
 }
\)
\end{texexample}


\section{Using \texttt{luacode}}

One very useful environment is \refEnv{luacode}.

\begin{docEnvironment}{luacode}{}
The luacode environment is similar to luaexec. You need to be careful to pass a macro that is fully expandable in order to work properly.
\end{docEnvironment}

\begin{texexample}{luacode environment}{ex:luacode}
\edef\foo{156789.0001}
\[
 \begin{luacode}
    tex.sprint("a=", math.sqrt(\foo),"+ z^3")
 \end{luacode}
\]
\end{texexample}

\section{Creating new environments}
\emphasis{luacode,endluacode,tex}
If you need to create new environment you will have to use the \lstinline!\luacode...\endluacode! form  rather than the begin...end.




\chapter{Finding where everything is}

One of the most frustrating things when you starting with a new language, is to find out where
everything is and if the various paths are correct. The snippet below does just that. It tests for a file using \lstinline!kpse.find_file!
\bigskip

%\emphasis{kpse,find}
%\begin{tcblisting}{}
%\begin{filecontents}{atest.tex}
%\end{filecontents}
%\begin{luacode}
%  -- kpse.set_program_name("lualatex")
%  -- uncomment if having problems
%  local file = "phd.dtx"
%  local path = kpse.find_file(file, '.dtx')
%    if path==nil then
%     tex.tprint({"\\color{red}"},{"File not found!"})
%   else
%     tex.tprint({path})
%   end
%\end{luacode}
%\end{tcblisting}

In the example, we created a small file on the fly, using \lstinline!filecontents! package. Then we test using \lstinline!kpse.find_file!. It returns true and we print the full path.

\subsection{the os library}
Getting the operating system type and name
\emphasis{kpse,find,require,os,name,lualibs,type}
\begin{tcblisting}{}
\begin{filecontents}{atest.tex}
\end{filecontents}
\begin{luacode}
  -- get the os name
  require("lualibs-os")
  local G,Y=os.name,os.type
  tex.tprint({G.."\\par"},{Y.."\\par"})
\end{luacode}
\end{tcblisting}

Gettting the runtime of a program

\begin{texexample}{}{}
\begin{filecontents}{atest.tex}
\end{filecontents}
\begin{luacode}
  -- get the os name
  require("lualibs-os")
  tex.print (">> ",os.runtime()," ms")
  tex.print({-2,os.uuid()})
  tex.print({-2,os.tmpname()})
\end{luacode}
\end{texexample}



\subsection{uuid}
\emphasis{os,uuid}
Getting a uuid or a slight variant of it we use \lstinline!os.uuid()!



\section{Reading from a file}

|\usepackage{luatextra}|


\begin{filecontents}{testdata10.dat}
  A  B
  1.0 20
  1.1 21
  1.2 22
\end{filecontents}
%
%\begin{texexample}{Reading from files}{ex:readfile}
%\begin{luacode*}
%function readtextfile()
%    file = io.open("testdata10.dat", "r")
%    for line1 in file:lines() do
%      --print(line1)
%      tex.print(line1)
%    end
%    file:close()
%end
%\end{luacode*}
%\directlua{readtextfile()}
%\end{texexample}
