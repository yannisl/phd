 \begin{summary}
   The commands defined in this file \texttt{ltfntcmd} are
   part of the kernel code for \LaTeXe/NFSS2.

   It is also meant to serve as documentation for package writers since
   it demonstrates how to define high-level font changing commands
   using a small number of creator functions.

 \section{Introduction}

 Font changes such as |\bfseries|, |\sffamily|, etc.\ are
 declarations; this means that their scope is delimited by the
 grouping structure, either by the next |\end| of some environment or
 by explicitly using a group, e.g., writing something like
 |{\bfseries...}| in the source. If you make the mistake of writing
 |\bfseries{...}| (thinking of |\bfseries| as a command with one
 argument) then the result is rather striking.

 Font declarations are an artifact of the \TeX{} system and for
 several reasons it is better to avoid them on the user level
 whenever possible.  In \LaTeX3 they will probably all be
 replaced by environments and by font commands taking one argument.

 This file defines a creator function for such declarative font
 switches.  This function creates commands which can be used in
 both math and text.

 This file also defines a number of high-level commands (all
 starting with |\text..|) that have one argument and typeset this
 argument in the requested way. Thus these commands are for
 typesetting short pieces of text in a specific family, series or
 shape.  These are all produced as examples of the use of a creator
 function which is itself also defined in this file.

 Table~\ref{tab:fontcmds} shows all these high-level commands in
 action.  A further advantage of using these commands is that they
 automatically take care of any necessary italic correction on either
 side of their argument.
 \begin{table}[t]

 \caption{Font-change commands with arguments}
 \label{tab:fontcmds}
 \begin{quote}
 The font change commands provided here
 all start with |\text..| to emphasize that they
 are for use in normal text and to be easily memorable. They
 automatically take care of any necessary italic correction on either
 side of the argument.
 \end{quote}
 \end{table}

 Thus, when using such commands, one does not have to worry about
 forgetting the italic correction when changing fonts.  Only in very
 few situations is this additional space wrong but, for example, most
 typographers recommend omitting the italic correction if a small
 punctuation character, like a comma, directly follows the font
 change.  Since the amount of correction required is partly a matter
 of taste, you can define in what situations the italic correction
 should be suppressed. This is done by putting the characters that
 should cancel a preceding italic correction in the list
 |\nocorrlist|.\footnote{Any package that changes the
 \texttt{\string\catcode} of a character inside
 \texttt{\string\nocorrlist} must then explicitly reset the list.
 Otherwise the changed character will no longer be recognized
 by the suppression algorithm.}
 The default definition for this list is produced by the following.
 \begin{verbatim}
 \newcommand \nocorrlist {,.}
 \end{verbatim}
 It is best to declare the most often used characters first, because
 this will make the processing slightly faster.  For example,
 \begin{verbatim}
 \emph{When using the \NFSS{} high-level commands,
 the \emph{proper} use of italic corrections is
 automatically taken care of}. Only
 \emph{sometimes} one has to help \LaTeX{} by
 adding a \verb=\nocorr= command.
 \end{verbatim}
 which results in:
 \begin{quote}
 \emph{When using the \NFSS{} high-level commands,
 the \emph{proper} use of italic corrections is
 automatically taken care of}. Only
 \emph{sometimes} one has to help \LaTeX{} by
 adding a \verb=\nocorr= command.
 \end{quote}

 In contrast, the use of the declaration forms is often more
 appropriate when you define your own commands or environments.
 \begin{verbatim}
 \newenvironment{bfitemize}{\begin{itemize}\normalfont\bfseries}
                           {\end{itemize}}
 \begin{bfitemize}
 \item This environment produces boldface items.
 \item It is defined in terms of \LaTeX's
   \texttt{itemize} environment and NFSS
   declarations.
 \end{bfitemize}
 \end{verbatim}
 This gives:
 \begin{quote}
 \newenvironment{bfitemize}
   {\begin{itemize}\normalfont\bfseries}
   {\end{itemize}}
 \begin{bfitemize}
 \item This environment produces boldface items.
 \item It is defined in terms of \LaTeX's
   \texttt{itemize} environment and NFSS
   declarations.
 \end{bfitemize}
 \end{quote}

 In addition to global customization of when to insert the italic
 correction, it is of course sometimes necessary to explicitly insert
 one with |\/|.

 It is also possible to suppress the italic correction
 in individual instances. For this, the command |\nocorr| is provided.

 The |\nocorr| must appear as the first or last token inside the
 braces of the argument of the |\text...| commands, at that end of
 the text where you wish to suppress the italic correction.


 It is worth pointing out here that inserting a |\/| in places where
 it can have no function (\ie anywhere except immediately after a
 slanted letter) is not an error---it will just be silently ignored.
 Unfortunately this is not true if the redefinition of |\/| in {\tt
 amstex.sty} is used as this version can cause space to be removed
 immediately before the |\/|.

\section{The implementation}
%
\begin{docCmd}{DeclareTextFontCommand}{ \marg{cmd}\marg{code} }
    This is the creator function for |\text..| commands.
    It gives a warning if |\foo| or |\fragfoo| is already defined.
\end{docCmd}

    In math mode it simply puts the font declaration and text into a
    box (possibly an automagically sized one).

    Otherwise it first scans the text to see where |\nocorr| occurs
    within it.  This sets the |\check@ic| commands to do what is
    necessary concerning the italic correction at both ends.

    The algorithm for deciding whether to put in an italic correction
    is not very subtle: one is added whenever the newly current font
    is not itself positively sloped, unless the next token is a
    character in the `nocorr' list.  At the end of the text this
    is done after closing the group so as to check the `outer font'.
    Note that this
    will often result in adding an italic correction token after a
    character in an unsloped font; we believe (in early 2003) that
    this is perhaps inefficient but not dangerous.

    It also now checks for empty contents of the text command and optimises
    this case.  Some care is also taken to check that doing dangerous
    things in vertical mode is avoided.

    The italic correction token is added to the horizontal list
    before (in the list) an immediately preceding non-zero glob of
    glue (skip) and any non-zero penalty preceding that since, in
    the typical case, this puts it immediately
    after the last character in the preceding word.

    Note that it is necessary to put in the |\aftergroup\maybe@ic| at
    the end of the group so that it comes after any other aftergroup
    tokens and immediately before the following tokens.
    It is also necessary to remove the |\fi| from the token list before
    the group ends; this is done by adding an |\expandafter| just
    before the closing brace.
