\chapter{Headers and Footers}

\thispagestyle{fancybook}
\pagestyle{fancybook}

\section{Introduction}

Publications would normally have headers and footers which orientate the user as to where the page is in relation to the rest of the publication. Running heads, as they are normally called by typographers include document properties and page properties, such as the page number, the title or short title of a book, author name and in business reports, one can find logos and dates. The difficulty with TeX is its asynchronous nature where page numbers and other marks such as chapter or section numbers can only be determined in the output routine.



\section{What LateX provides}

Headers and footers in \latex are controlled by two control sequences, \docAuxCommand*{pagestyle}\marg{style name} and \docAuxCommand*{thispagestyle}\marg{style name}. These refer not to page dimensions, but to the running headers and footers of a document. These headers typically contain document titles, chapter or section numbers, copyright notices and page numbers, as described earlier.


\subsection{Standard page styles}

The possibilities of changing the headers in \latexe are  limited. There are two commands available: |\pagestyle{style}| will apply the specified style to the current and all subsequent pages, and |\thispagestyle{style}| will only affect the current page. The possible styles are:

\begin{description}
\item[empty]	Both header and footer are cleared
plain	Header is clear, but the footer contains the page number in the center.
\item[headings]	Footer is blank, header displays information according to document class (e.g., section name) and page number top right.
\item[myheadings]	Page number is top right, and it is possible to control the rest of the header.
\end{description}

This page has been styled using the |\thispagestyle|\marg{myheadings} and as you can see has a small page number at top right. This is not normal for chapter opening pages, but I have included it to demonstrate the |\thispagestyle{}|


With \docAuxCommand*{pagestyle}\meta{myheadings}, the commands |\markright| (in the standard document classes, |book|, |report| and |article|) and \docAuxCommand*{markboth} (only in the book class) are used to control the headings. The following commands placed at the beginning of an article document will set the header of all pages to contain ``John Smith'' top left, ``On page styles'' centered and the page number top right:


\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small]{latex}
\pagestyle{myheadings}
\markright{John Smith\hfill On page styles\hfill}
\markboth{John Smith\hfill On page styles\hfill}%
         {\hfill  John Smith\hfill On page styles\hfill}
\end{minted}

\section{Packages}
fancyhdr is the classical package. The last change has been 6 years ago.

scrpage2 has been available for years but is also developing currently together with the modern KOMA-script classes. Naturally it is better integrated with those classes but it may be used with other classes as well.

fancyhdr provides a head rule and a foot rule, but scrpage2 offers head top line, head separation line, foot separation line and foot bottom line.

scrpage2 comes with a sophisticated interface to specify own styles, beginning with a simple |\deftripstyle| taking 9 parameters complemented by an expert interface: |\defpagestyle|, |\newpagestyle|, |\renewpagestyle| and |\providepagestyle|, see documentation.

To ease work with different styles scrpage2 reads and processes a file scrpage.cfg where several styles for many projects might be defined.

So, I would prefer scrpage2 if it's available. I'm sure it can replace fancyhdr. The latter package might be preferred if the requirements aren't too sophisticated and quick learning is expected.

Note: if you use fancyhdr and geometry, load geometry first.
Another package \pkg{titleps} by Javier Bezos (the author of enumitem, titlesec, and titletoc), provides page styles with a simple one-stage mechanism, including top marks; access to top-, first- and botmarks in a single header/footer; headers/footers for specific floats; multiple sets of marks (with e-TeX), and more.

\section{Using the fancyvrb package}

Most LaTeX users, when redesigning running headers or footers will use the \pkg{fancyhdr} package. This well established package by Piet van Oostrum, allows easy customization of page headers and footers. The default page style provided by fancyhdr is named \textit{fancy}.  It should be activated via
\lstinline{\pagestyle} after any changes to textwidth are made, as fancyhdr initializes
the header and footer widths using the current value of this length.

The look and feel of the fancy page style is determined by six declarations that define the material that will appear on the left, center, and right of the header
and footer areas. For example, \cmd{lhead} specifies what should show up on the left
in the header area, while \cmd{cfoot} defines what will appear in the center of the
footer area. The results of all six declarations are shown in the next example. Note that we have to provide values for 12 fields, since each command has both optional as well as mandatory values.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small]{latex}
\lhead[<even output>]{<odd output>}
\chead[<even output>]{<odd output>}
\rhead[<even output>]{<odd output>}

\lfoot[<even output>]{<odd output>}
\cfoot[<even output>]{<odd output>}
\rfoot[<even output>]{<odd output>}
\end{minted}

\begin{tabular}{ll}
E  &Even page\\
O &Odd page\\
L  &Left field\\
C &Center field\\
R &Right field\\
H &Header\\
F  &Footer\\
\end{tabular}

You can use fancyhdr to facilitate making headers and footers. If you want the first page to have no header or footer---without using any special packages---you can issue |\thispagestyle{empty}| on the first page.


\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small]{latex}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{lipsum}
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\pagestyle{fancy}
\lhead{This is my name}
\rhead{this is page \thepage}
\cfoot{center of the footer!}
\renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0.4pt}
\renewcommand{\footrulewidth}{0.4pt}
\begin{document}
\thispagestyle{empty}
\lipsum[1-20]
\end{document}
\end{minted}

\chapter{User Manual for phd-runningheads}

The \pkg{phd} suite of packages, which is still in development has taken a totally different approach. My approach is that users are getting confused with too many macros, require a steep learning curve, first to understand how \tex works and then go through a process familiarizing themeselves with \latexe. Both Knuth and Lamport did not envisage that users will want to design their own documents, but rather had some preconceived ideas as to how they would look. The approach I have used is that the user interface should be declarative and if possible, not to require the typing of any commands. Here is an example:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small]{latex}
\cxset{
    % even pages
    headings even header left             = page,
    headings even header center           = none,
    headings even header right            = rightmark, 
    headings even footer left             = page,
    headings even footer center           = shorttitle,
    headings even footer right            = today,
    % odd pages
    headings odd header left              = leftmark,
    headings odd header center            = none,
    headings odd header right             = page, 
    headings odd footer left              = today,
    headings odd footer center            = none,
    headings odd footer right             = none, 
}
\end{minted}


%\section{Description of the header engine}
%
%The header engine works by defining three vertical regions to contain a top and bottom rule or other material and a middle layer that contains the text and or graphical material. In its simpler form is an assembly of boxes as shown in figure~\ref{fig:headerengine} .
%\medskip
%
%\noindent\vbox{
%
%\framebox[80pt]{toprule}
%
%\fbox{\fbox{offset}$\rightarrow$\fbox{\fbox{name} \fbox{number} \fbox{title} \fbox{page number}}}
%
%\framebox[80pt]{bottomrule}
%
%\captionof{figure}{Typical assembly of boxes for a header}
%\label{fig:headerengine}
%}
%
%Of course the order of display of the various components can vary, for example in figure~\ref{fig:headerengine01}, we have the page number to the left.
%
%\noindent\fbox{\vbox{%
%oddhead\par
%\framebox[80pt]{toprule}
%
%\fbox{\fbox{offset}$\rightarrow$\fbox{\fbox{page number}\fbox{name} \fbox{number} \fbox{title} }}
%
%\framebox[80pt]{bottomrule}
%
%\captionof{figure}{Typical assembly of boxes for a header}
%\label{fig:headerengine01}
%}}
%
%The LaTeX engine as previously described allows for an oddhead and evenhead macros to hold the typesetting information. The typesetting information is obtained asynchrnously,
%\begin{comment}
%The chaptermark assembles and stores
%
%\fbox{\fbox{chapter name}$\rightarrow$\fbox{chapter number}$\rightarrow$\fbox{chapter title}}
%
%whereas the sectionamark similarly stores information on section numbering:
%
%\begin{figure}[h]
%\fbox{\fbox{section name}\fbox{section number}\fbox{section title}}
%\end{figure}
%
%This information of the mark macros is then activated by the leftmark and rightmark commands and when the typesetter calls the oddhead and evenhead the page number is added. So to have a complete definition
%we need to define both the marks as well as the oddhead and evenhead macros. Similarly the pagenumber's position can vary in different designs.
%
%The approach we took is to firstly extend the informtion held in each box, for example, the chaptername
%looks more like:
%
%\begin{figure}[h]
%   \fbox{chaptername before}$\rightarrow$\fbox{chaptername}$\rightarrow$\fbox{chapternameafter}
%\end{figure}
%
%Similarly the header elements, \textit{name, number, title} and \textit{pagenumer}  hold information to add material before and after the element. This adds complexity, but generalizes and abstracts the problem nicely.
%
%Now back to leftmarks and rightmarks. The leftmark or rightmark is called by the oddside or evenside macros. We suitably add macros for before and after.
%
%\fbox{before mark}$\rightarrow$\fbox{leftmark or rightmark}$\rightarrow$\fbox{after mark}

\subsection{Discussion}

One would argue that this is a convoluted way of describing the header and footers. However, to have a truly flexible system (with no macro writing for designers and authors) one has to resort to such a long way. It is in many respects simlar to CSS. A looks description language needs as many variables and as much flexibility as possible. The one up on CSS is that the template can be saved and themes developed and invoked very simply.

\subsection{Example settings}
\index{Styles>style56}
\index{Header and footers!example}

To define a style based on the \textit{headings} pagestyle. We will base the style definition on figure~\ref{globalstrategy}. The interesting part of this design is that the chapter numbers are not shown shown in the introduction (which is treated as front matter material). The rest of the chapters are numbered, although the header information and styling remains the same.

\begin{figure}[hp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{chapter56}\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./images/chapter56a}
\caption{Example pages from \textit{Global Competitive Strategy}, by Daniel F. Spulber,} Cambridge University Press, 2007.
\label{globalstrategy}
\end{figure}

The interesting part of this design is that the headers as well as the chapter openings vary. On the even page the words ``Global Competitive Strategy'' are printed, which is the book title\footnote{Although it is an attractive design, it does not mean that this way of header information is a good way of structuring information.}.

Note that since LaTeX only provides two mark we need to arrange our own typesetting rules, we will abuse the macros to achieve it.

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{lstlisting}
\cxset{headings style56/.style={
          pagestyle=headings,
          header style=headings,
% Chaptermarks
          chaptermark name color=black,
          chaptermark after number=,
          chaptermark name=SHORT BOOK TITLE,
          chaptermark numbering=none,
          chaptermark title color=black!80,
          chaptermark title before=\@gobble,
% Leftmarks
          leftmark before=\colorbox{thegray!50}{\thepage\quad}\quad, %even pages
          leftmark after=\hfill\hfill,
% Right marks influenced by chapter name?
          rightmark before=\colorbox{thegray!50}{\thepage\quad}\quad, %odd pages
          rightmark after=\hfill\hfill,
% Section marks
          sectionmark name custom=\chaptertitle@cx,
          sectionmark number=none,
          sectionmark name color=black,
          sectionmark title color=black!80,
          sectionmark before title=\@gobble, % we do not need the section title
          sectionmark after title=\hfill\hfill,
          sectionmark after number=,
%  rules we remove or inherit
%       header top rule=false,
          header bottom rule=true,
          header offset even=-1.3cm,
          header offset odd=-1.3cm,
          }}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{tcolorbox}

The approach we need to take here is to first define the even pages, which contain the book short title. Instead of printing the \cs{chaptername}, we give the value of the title to the \textbf{chaptermark} key.

\begin{tcolorbox}
   chaptermark name = SHORT BOOK TITLE,
\end{tcolorbox}

Offsetting the page numbers is done by using the \textbf{header offset} key. As both the left as well as the right pages have the page on the left we offset both of them by the same amount.

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{lstlisting}
    chaptermark name = SHORT BOOK TITLE,
    header offset even = -1.3cm,
    header offset odd  = -1.3cm,
\end{lstlisting}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Inheriting and transforming styles}

One of the advantages of this method, is that we can inherit styles and transform styles easily. Consider |style57|, which is shown in figure. This is a simple design and follows trends to include the book title in the header. This is a very similar design to header \textit{style57}.

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{lstlisting}
%% STYLE 57 QUANTUM FRONTIER
\cxset{headings style57/.style={
          headings style56,
% Chaptermarks
          chaptermark name={\bfseries The Quantum Frontier},
% Leftmarks
          leftmark before=\thepage\quad, %even pages
          leftmark after=\hfill\hfill,
% Right marks influenced by chapter name?
          rightmark before=\hfill\hfill, %odd pages
          rightmark after=\thepage,
% Section marks
          sectionmark name custom=\chaptertitle@cx,
          sectionmark after title=\quad,
%  rules we remove or inherit
          header top rule=false,
          header bottom rule=false,
          header offset even=0pt,
          header offset odd=0pt,
          }}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{tcolorbox}

A crude form of object inheritance is possible by including a style at the top of the key definitions in this case \texttt{headings style56}, we then only need to redefine the values for the changes. We also set zero all offsets and adjust the widths.

The success of the method is defining an appropriate set of general commands and building a community chest of styles.

This concludes the long excursion into headers and footers. This class and method of styling is brand new and is bound to evolve, as it is being used. Feedback is most welcomed as well as bug reports.
\begin{figure}[tp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{chapter57a}\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
\caption{Example pages from \textit{The quantum frontier: the large hadron collider}, by Don Lincoln, The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2009.  It uses the book short-title at even pages and the chapter title at the odd pages.}
\end{figure}

\section{Another inheritance example}

This example is from the book \textit{Evolution of the Insects} by David Grimaldi and Michael S. Engel and published by the Cambridge University Press in 2005. It is a beautifully typeset book and a fine piece of scientific work. The only difference in the headers of the previous examples is the setting of the page number and header text. This one as well as many other books uses the title of the book and the chapter name.

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{lstlisting}
%% EVOLUTION OF THE INSECTS
\cxset{headings style58/.style={
          headings style57,
          chaptermark name={\bfseries EVOLUTION OF THE INSECTS},
          leftmark before=\thepage\quad\hfill\hfill, %even pages
          leftmark after=,
          rightmark before=, %odd pages
          rightmark after=\hfill\hfill\thepage,
 }}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{tcolorbox}

Since most of the information was captured in \textit{style57} we inherit the values and only supply the ones  that are changing. This involves changing six settings, illustrating the strength of the procedure adopted. Just a word of caution I found it difficult to follow some of the terminology, if you confused by what a leftmark and right mark are think of them as holding all the header information except the page number.

%
%The \LaTeX2e\ method of constructing the layout for Chapters is complicated and spread all over the book.cls code. Although not very difficult to customize, customization is not user friendly.
%
%\begin{description}
%\item [counters] Counters can be displayed or not. These are constructed using the normal LaTeX method.
%   \begin{verbatim}
%   \renewcommand \thechapter {\@arabic\c@chapter}
%   \end{verbatim}
%
%\item [name] Here we use the term \textit{name} to denote in english the word ``chapter''. This can be typeset differently, depending on the language. It depends on on redefining one macro.
%   \begin{verbatim}
%     \def\chaptername{Chapter}
%   \end{verbatim}
%\item [openright] The global option open right, triggers the typesetting of chapter on odd pages only. There are a  couple of layouts that must be typeset on an even pages.
%
%\item [\string\chapter] The chapter command is the main author command and where all the branching starts.
%    \begin{verbatim}
%\newcommand\chapter{%
%  \if@openright\cleardoublepage\else\clearpage\fi
%    \thispagestyle{plain}%
%    \global\@topnum\z@

%
%One limitation for this command is that it always starts a chapter on a new page and the macro needs to be rewritten if for example a new chapter is allowed to start anywhere.
%
%Consider options openright, openleft, continuous.
%
%The pagestyle is also settled here.
%
%secdef will define basic macros for chaapter and starred chapter. What it basically does... this will become unecessary as we are going to find out a bit later on, but first the @chapter.

%{Sample\\ Chapter\\ Styles}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The many permutations of variables affecting a chapter design, necessitate an interface that is easy to use and remember. The package provides an interface that a design can simply be changed by changing one word.
%\item Learn how to select from a number of predefined styles, which you can view in the pages that follow.
%\item Learn how to design your own styles and incorporate them easily in a new document.
%\item The designs that follow have been selected from actual books. They may differ slightly in page geometry, spacing and fonts as I have tried to keep a somewhat unified design across this document.
%\item i welcome contributions in terms of libraries and additional styles. What I have provided in this package is only a very small subset of what is possible to achieve.
%\item Almost all styles are numbered, as this was the easiest way to incorporate so many designs. The few exceptions are noted in the relevant pages.
