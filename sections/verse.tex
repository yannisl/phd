\epigraph{"Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary."}{---John Keating, Dead Poets Society (1989)}

\newcommand{\garden}{
I used to love my garden \\
But now my love is dead \\
For I found a bachelor's button \\
In black-eyed Susan's bed.

Typographical standards require poetry to be `'centered on the longest line, unless such line is disproportionately long, in which case optical centring''. \textit{The oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors}, which presents the house style of
the Oxford University Press). 


\section{Using the verse package}



\begin{lstlisting}[language={[common]TeX},% 
                           alsolanguage={[LaTeX]TeX},% 
                           alsolanguage={[primitive]TeX},%
                           alsolanguage={extras}]
\renewcommand{\poemtoc}{subsection}
\poemtitle{A Limerick}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{There was an old party of Lyme}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
    There was an old party of Lyme \\
    Who married three wives at one time. \\
    \vin When asked: `Why the third?' \\
    \vin He replied: `One's absurd, \\
    And bigamy, sir, is a crime.'
\end{verse}
\end{lstlisting}


which gets typeset as below. The default \doccmd{poemtoc}  is redefined to subsection so
the title is entered into the ToC as an unnumbered subsection.

\newlength{\aaaa}
\settowidth{\aaaa}{ZZZZ}

\renewcommand{\poemtoc}{subsection}
\poemtitle{A Limerick}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{There was an old party of Lyme}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
    There was an old party of Lyme \\
     Who married three wives at one time. \\
    \vin When asked: `Why the third?' \\
    \ZZZZ He replied: `One's absurd, \\
And bigamy, sir, is a crime.'
\end{verse}

Next is the Garden verse within the altverse environment. It is titled and
centered.

\settowidth{\versewidth}{But now my love is dead}
\poemtitle{Love's lost}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\begin{altverse}
\garden
\end{altverse}
\end{verse}


which produces:

\settowidth{\versewidth}{But now my love is dead}
\poemtitle{Love's lost}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
    \begin{altverse}
    \garden
\end{altverse}
\end{verse}


It is left up to you how you might want to add information about the author
of a poem. Here is one example of a macro for this:

\begin{lstlisting}[language={[common]TeX},% 
                           alsolanguage={[LaTeX]TeX},% 
                           alsolanguage={[primitive]TeX},%
                           alsolanguage={extras}]
\newcommand{\attrib}[1]{%
\nopagebreak{\raggedleft\footnotesize #1\par}}
\end{lstlisting}

\newcommand{\attrib}[1]{%
\nopagebreak{\raggedleft\footnotesize #1\par}}
This can be used as in the next bit of doggeral.

\poemtitle{Fleas}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{What a funny thing is a flea}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
What a funny thing is a flea. \\
You can't tell a he from a she. \\
 But he can. And she can. \\
 Whoopee!
\end{verse}
\attrib{Anonymous}


Here is an example of line wrapping.
\poemtitle{In the beginning}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{And objects at rest tended to remain at rest}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Then God created Newton, \\*
And objects at rest tended to remain at rest, \\*
And objects in motion tended to remain in motion, \\*
And energy was conserved
and momentum was conserved
and matter was conserved \\*
And God saw that it was conservative.
\end{verse}
\attrib{Possibly from \textit{Analog}, circa 1950}



Here is one with a forced line break and a slightly different title style.

\begin{lstlisting}[language={[common]TeX},% 
                           alsolanguage={[LaTeX]TeX},% 
                           alsolanguage={[primitive]TeX},%
                           alsolanguage={extras}]
\renewcommand{\poemtitlefont}{\normalfont\large\itshape\centering}
\poemtitle{Mathematics}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Than Tycho Brahe, or Erra Pater:}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
    In mathematics he was greater \\
    Than Tycho Brahe, or Erra Pater: \\
    For he, by geometric scale, \\
   Could take the size of pots of ale;\\ \settowidth{\versewidth}{Resolve by}
   Resolve, by sines \\>[\versewidth] and tangents straight, \\
   If bread or butter wanted weight; \\
   And wisely tell what hour o' the day \\
   The clock does strike, by Algebra.
\end{verse}
\attrib{Samuel Butler (1612--1680)}
\end{lstlisting}

The typesetting now is slightly different but still not what is probably required in a poetry book

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
    In mathematics he was greater \\
    Than Tycho Brahe, or Erra Pater: \\
    For he, by geometric scale, \\
   Could take the size of pots of ale;\\ \settowidth{\versewidth}{Resolve by}
   Resolve, by sines \\>[\versewidth] and tangents straight, \\
   If bread or butter wanted weight; \\
   And wisely tell what hour o' the day \\
   The clock does strike, by Algebra.
\end{verse}
\attrib{Samuel Butler (1612--1680)}
\bigskip


Another limerick, but this time taking advantage of the patverse environment
and numbering every third line.

\begin{lstlisting}[language={[common]TeX},% 
                           alsolanguage={[LaTeX]TeX},% 
                           alsolanguage={[primitive]TeX},%
                           alsolanguage={extras}]
\settowidth{\versewidth}{There was a young lady of Ryde}
\poemtitle{The Young Lady of Ryde}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\poemlines{3}
\indentpattern{00110}
\begin{patverse}
There was a young lady of Ryde \\
Who ate some apples and died. \\
The apples fermented \\
Inside the lamented \\
And made cider inside her inside.
\end{patverse}
\poemlines{0}
\end{verse}
\end{lstlisting}


The  poem on the next page is a bit more involved. Here we use a bigskip between the verses of the poem. Also note
the use of the emdash, which is commonly found in poetry books. The command \doccmd{vin} is from the verse class
and it justs sets the second line in. The figure which is from the same publication was set with a marginfigure and the
vertical height was manually adjusted. Poetry typesetting is highly unlikely to be done automatically. Each poem is
special and would normally be typset to suit.

\poemtitle{ON JORDAN'S BANKS}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
On Jordan's banks the Arab camels stray,\\
On Sion's hill the False One's votaries pray---\\

Yet there---even there---O God! thy thunders sleep:\\

There, where thy finger scorch'd the tablet stone;\\
There, where thy shadow to thy people shone---\\
Thy glory shrouded in its garb of fire\\
(Thyself none living see and not expire).\\

Oh! in the lightning let thy glance appear---\\
Sweep from his shiver'd hand the oppressor's spear!\\
How long by tyrants shall thy land be trod?\\
How long thy temple worshipless, O God!\\

 Using the |alltt| environment you can put in the spacing via ordinary
 spaces. That is, this

\begin{texexample}{}{}
 \begin{alltt}\normalfont
 There was an old party of Lyme
 Who married three wives at one time.
       When asked: `Why the third?' 
       He replied: `One's absurd, 
 And bigamy, sir, is a crime.'
 \end{alltt}
\end{texexample}

 is typeset as

 \begin{alltt}
 \normalfont
 There was an old party of Lyme
 Who married three wives at one time.
       When asked: `Why the third?' 
       He replied: `One's absurd, 
 And bigamy, sir, is a crime.'
 \end{alltt}
