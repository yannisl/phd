\chapter[Charts and Visualizations]{Presenting Data in Charts and Visualizations}
\label{ch:charts}
\pagestyle{headings}

There can be no doubt that the hallmark of scientific reports and publications is the graphical presentation of the results. Graphs show relationships underlying observations in a way no other device can provide\footnote{\textit{Doing science: design, analysis, and communication of scientific research}
 By Ivan Valiela}.  Charting is both an art and a science. Modern typography on charts and infographics look at Tufte as inspiration.
Tufte advocates to minimize the ink to data ratio and although this is not always possible it is good advice.
In this section we would look at charting in general which is probably of interest to most of the readers
in this book.  Another good source of information is Stephen Few’s website the \href{perpetualedge}{perceptualedge} \footnote{\protect\url{http:\\perceptualedge.com}}  with a number of excellent articles on data visualization.

This chapter will focus more on charting rather than visualizations, as widely understood. These are best painted with a different tool.

In his book Tufte advocates that science and art have in common \emph{intense seeing}, the wide-eyed observing that generates empirical information. \textit{Beautiful Evidence} is about how \emph{seeing} is turned into \emph{showing}. \cite{Tufte2006}}

\section{Graphical Perception}

When a person looks at a graph, the information is decoded by the person’s visual system. A graphical method is successful only if the decoding is effective. Cleveland \cite{cleveland1985} in an often quoted study designed experiments and made suggestions as to how graphical data can be improved by selecting representations that have high rank in Table~ref{tbl:cleveland}. Cleveland and McGill at the time employed as statistical scientists at At \& T Bell Laboratories, investigated how we perceive quantitative information and produced a table as to how to order elementary tasks by accuracy. They suggested graphs should exploit tasks as high in the ordering as possible. The tasks are ordered from most accurate to least.


\begin{longtable}[c]{l>{\RaggedRight}p{7.5cm}}
\caption{Rank table for chart visual representation.}\label{tbl:ranktable} \\
\toprule
Rank  & Position along a common scale\\
\midrule
1  & Position along a common scale\\
2  & Position on identical but nonaligned scales\\
3  & Length\\
4  & Angle\\
    & Slope (with $\theta$ not too close to 0, $\pi/2$, or $\pi$ radians)\\
5   & Area\\
6   &Volume\\
     &Density\\
     &Colour saturation\\
7   & Colour hue\\         
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\caption{The top panel is a divided bar chart. This graphical method requires length judgement; for example
to compare and order the values in group A is not easy. In the bottom panel the values are shown by a dot
chart. All values on the graph can be visually compared by judgements of position along a common scale, an
easier task. Now the ordering of the values in group A is easy to perceive. Adapted from \cite{cleveland1985}.}

\section{How to Draw your Charts}

With the newer engines the limitations of fonts are now part of TeX’s history, so you can use other programs. However, the use of PGF and TikZ or pstricks is still an unbeatable way to produce high quality charts and graphs.
For visualizations other tools might be necessary. Asymptote is on of them and I am sure you have other in your toolbox.

\section{Tufte like charts}

During the last stages of a Project, it maybe easier to visualize the
main areas where effort needs to be exerted by using simple charts. One
such chart is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tufte-overall}. When this chart
was prepared efforts were made to complete the physical installation
as well as plan and commission the plant. The use of colour in this
chart highlights the commissioning, so one can easily see the expectations. Although the percentages are written on top of the bars,
one need not read them to visualize how difficult is to achieve
100\% completion in a Project. On the other hand commissiong can go
fairly fast and can jump by a large percentage, just by
commissioning a couple of additional ELV systems that have approximately
a 10\% weigh factor.

One can easily fit approximately, six to seven months data on
a portrait chart, changing it around to landscape one can fit
more than a year. Personally I am not very happy with such long
projections as they are more like guesses rather than proper estimates.

One other chart that can be used to visualize progress and is more
commonly found in construction is the infamous S-curve. Now, if
the actual planning is detailed enough and granular enough to be
able to pin-point \textit{continuous} progress then it is
appropriate. using it if you can at least obtain weekly progress
estimates.

A good graph is uncluttered, clear and focused.

\subsection{Axis Lines}

Most problems with graphs arise from misuse of axes: too heavy, too long, wrong intersection,
ambiquous breaks or too confusing increments and incorrect proportions. An axis is a ruler that established
regular intervals for measuring the information provided. Axes may emphasize, diminish, distort, simplify
or clutter the information.

\clearpage

\begin{multicols}{2}
\subsection{Axis Length}

Graphs should utilize their space around them, as the graph itself is mostly white space. In publications the journal might want to minimize the cost of printing. An axis should not extend beyond the labeled unit od minor tick closest to the last data point.

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8]
\begin{axis}
\addplot coordinates {
(0,0)
(0.5,1)
(1,2)
};
\addplot coordinates {
(0,0)
(0.9,1.3)
(1.2,2.5)
};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\captionsetup[figure]{format=hang, name=Fig, font=footnotesize}
\captionof{figure}{Example Chart. This chart has no legend and also has no lables to indicate what the y-axis and x-axis represent.}
\label{fig:exchart}
\medskip


For example the chart shown in figure \ref{fig:exchart} has been typeset within a multicolumns environment and has utilized the space around it effectively. However it suffers from other short-comings. 

A figure, much like a table, has to be self-contained. No detail (symbol, line, etc.) of the figure should go undefined. In cases in which symbol
identifications are too long to be included in the data field, they are
included in the figure legend. Figure legends consist of figure numbers
and titles. The figure legend should briefly report what is in the graph,
not discuss the methods or meaning of the data. For reasons unknown
to me, it is customary for figure legends to be set below the graph;3
in contrast, you will recall that legends for tables are set on top of the
tables. \cite{ivan2001}

One should also consider the absence of axes, where they t represent.

\section{The bullet graph}

The bullet graph is considered\footnote{\protect\url{http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=375}} to be a  better alternative to gauges in dashboards. A solution to a basic chart can be found at tx.se\footnote{\url{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/117314/is-there-any-package-to-create-bullet-gauge-graphs}}, by Jake, which sadly in a community of mathematicians, engineers and programmers was not popularized to the extend it deserved. 

Bullet gauges are commonly used to show the current state relative to a reference value with a background that divides the scale into regions.

Formatting: The color is preferable to be a range of distinct hues, which can also assist by those who are colorblind. It is also reproduced better when photocopies.  Intensities are preferred as follows:

three: 40\%, 25\% and 10\%

      marker = 300}
   -- render the plot
   m:render(data,options)           
\end{bulletgraph}
\end{scriptexample}

Use an updated pgfplotsversion as we use |\pgfplotsset{compat=1.11}|, when we load the \pkgname{phd}. The environment |\begin{bulletgraph}|  is a |\luacode|  based environment and hence all the code has to be in lua syntax.

The code load the lua module |bulletgraph| and we the graph is rendered using the method \luacmd{render()}. The method, like most of the plotting routines provided by the package takes two arguments |data| and |options|.

\begin{texexample}{Bullet Plots}{ex:bulletplot}
\begin{bulletgraph}
local  bgraph = require("i18n.bulletgraph")
local data = {
     title = 'Valuation (Jan)',
     ranges = {230,300,500},
     bar = 200,
     marker = 220}
local options = {
        barcolour = 'red!90'
   } 
bgraph:render(data,options)        
\end{bulletgraph}
\end{texexample}

If you are familiar with Javascript you must have come across jQuery and its many plugins. The bulletgraph methods work in a similar fashion, where the options are a set of key values, that are used as a mixin with a set of default key values. If you only want to change the color of the bar, you only specify the color in the options the rest
are inherited from default values. All the \pkgname{phd} package routines, follow this design pattern to simplify the user interface and to enable typographical styles to be maintained throughout a publication. The best way to draw such charts is without the |options|. This separation of the interface, it also separates the data from the presentational aspects of drawing the plots.

\begin{texexample}{Bullet Plots (without options)}{ex:bulletplot1}
\begin{bulletgraph}
local  bgraph = require("i18n.bulletgraph")
local data = {
     title = 'Valuation (Jan)',
     ranges = {230,300,500},
     bar = 200,
     marker = 220}
bgraph:render(data,options)        
\end{bulletgraph}
\end{texexample}

\section{Using matplotlib}

Many researchers use Python to produce charts. A good guide can be found at \href{https://github.com/jbmouret/matplotlib_for_papers}{jbmournet} at github. There was also a good discussion at HN\footnote{\protect\url{https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9043571}}.
