The output routine is one of the more mysterious pieces
of \tex.
and as  David Salomon noted\footnote{TUGboat/tb-11-1/tb27salomon.pdf}, advanced users hardly need to be convinced that an unerstanding of OTRs is important, since they must be used whenever, special output is desired.
 The chapter of the \texbook discussing output
routines claims that designing output routines makes one:

\begin{quote}
achieve the level of a `\tex Grandmaster'.
As is so often the case, mastery of the concept of an
output routine in plain \tex will only barely prepare you
for the complexities awaiting you with \latexe's variant of
an output routine.
\end{quote}


The subject is considered complex for the following reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
\item OTRS are asynchronous with the
rest of TEX (this is explained later) and involve difficult concepts such as splitting boxes and insertions.
\item Certain features, which could be useful in OTRs are not supported by \tex. Specifically there are no commands to identify marks, rules and |whatsits| in a box and to break up a line of text into individual characters.
\end{enumerate}

\tex\ 's page breaking algorithm is simpler than the line breaking one. The reason for this is that global optimization
of page breakpoints, the way is done in the paragraph algorithm is prohibitively in terms of memory (especially in the 1980s).

Theoretically, page breaking is a more complicated \footnote{\href{test}{http://www.cs.utk.edu/~eijkhout/594-LaTeX/handouts/breaking/page-tutorial.pdf}}than line breaking. First we will briefly discuss the algoithms that \tex\ actually
uses.


\section{Page breaking algorithm}

The problem of page breaking has two components. One is that of stretching or shrinking
available glue (mostly around display math or section headings) to find typographically
desirable breakpoints. The other is that of placing ‘floating’ material, such as tables and
figures. These are typically placed at the top or the bottom of a page, on or after the first
page where they are referenced. These ‘inserts’, as they are called in TEX, considerably
complicate the page breaking algorithms, as well as the theory.

\subsection{Typographical constraints}

There are various typographical guidelines for what a page should look like, and \tex has
mechanisms that can encourage, if not always enforce, this behaviour.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The first line of every page should be at the same distance from the top. This changes
if the page starts with a section heading which is a larger type size.

\item The last line should also be at the same distance, this time from the bottom. This
is easy to satisfy if all pages only contain text, but it becomes harder if there are
figures, headings, and display math on the page. In that case, a ‘ragged bottom’ can
be specified.

\item  A page may absolutely not be broken between a section heading and the subsequent
paragraph or subsection heading.

\item It is desirable that

\begin{enumerate}
\item the top of the page does not have the last line of a paragraph started on the
preceding page

\item the bottom of the page does not have the first line of a paragraph that continues
on the next page.
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}



For ordinary purposes you will probably find that \tex's automatic
method of page breaking is satisfactory. And when it occasionally gives unpleasant
results, you can force the machine to break at your favorite place by
typing |\eject|. But be careful: |eject| will cause \tex to stretch the page
out, if necessary, so that the top and bottom baselines agree with those on other
pages.  If you want to eject a short page, filling it with blank space at the bottom,
type | \vfill\eject|  instead.

\section{The current page and the recent contributions list}

The main vertical list of TEX is divided in two parts: the \emph{current page} and the list of \emph{recent
contributions}. Any material that is added to the main vertical list is appended to the recent
contributions; the act of moving the recent contributions to the current page is known as
\emph{exercising the page builder}.

Every time something is moved to the current page, TEX computes the cost of breaking the
page at that point. If it decides that it is past the optimal point, the current page up to the
best break so far is put in |box255| and the remainder of the current page is moved back
on top of the recent contributions. If the page is broken at a penalty, that value is recorded
in |outputpenalty|, and a penalty of size 10 000 is placed on top of the recent contributions;
otherwise, |outputpenalty| is set to 10 000.

If the current page is empty, discardable items that are moved from the recent contributions
are discarded. This is the mechanism that lets glue disappear after a page break and at the
top of the first page. When the first non-discardable item is moved to the current page, the
|topskip| glue is inserted; 



\section{When is the page builder activated?}


The page builder comes into play in the following circumstances.

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Around paragraphs: after the \cs{everypar} tokens have been inserted, and after the
paragraph has been added to the vertical list. See the end of this chapter for an
example.

\item  Around display formulas: after the \cs{everydisplay} tokens have been inserted, and after
the display has been added to the list.

\item  After \cs{par} commands, boxes, insertions, and explicit penalties in vertical mode.

\item  After an output routine has ended.
\end{enumerate}



In these places the page builder moves the recent contributions to the current page. Note that
\tex\  need not be in vertical mode when the page builder is exercised. In horizontal mode,
activating the page builder serves to move preceding vertical glue (for example, \cs{parskip},
\cs{abovedisplayskip}) to the page.

The \cs{end} command – which is only allowed in external vertical mode – terminates a TEX job,
but only if the main vertical list is empty and \cs{deadcycles} = 0. If this is not the case the
combination


|\hbox{}\vfill\penalty+ $-2^{30}$|

is appended, which forces the output routine to act.

\section{The depth of the current page}
The depth of the page is important since normally in good typesetting successive pages should have the same (or almost the same vertical size. (flushbottom). The height of a page is controlled and set exactly by \tex equal to |\vsize|. Consider a large |vbox| with lines of text, glue and penalties. The depth of this box, is the depth of the last component [80]. If the last component is a glue or penalty, the depth is zero. If it is a box, then its depth becomes the depth of the entire |\vbox|, except that it is limited to the value of parameter |\boxmaxdepth|.

If
|\boxmaxdepth=1pt| and the depth of the bottom box
is 1.94444pt, then the depth of the entire |\vbox|
will be 1pt and its height will be incremented
by .94444pt. This is equivalent to lowering the
reference point (or, equivalently, the baseline) of
the |\vbox| by .94444pt. In the plain format,
|\boxmaxdepth=\maxdimen| [348], so it has no effect
on the depths of boxes. However, |\boxmaxdepth|
can always be changed by the user \footnote{This \texttt{\textbackslash boxmaxdepth} setting is to ensure that deep footnotes do not overwrite the
footer (on account of the negative skip added later): it should use \texttt{\textbackslash @maxdepth}
otherwise the change is pointless when there are footnotes.
But see also its use when combining 
floats.  \latex uses a value of 5.5pt whereas plain a value of 4pt [348].}



If the last line on a page, contains letters that happen to not have any depth, the page depth will be zero. Try for example this:

\begin{teXXX}
....
\showthe\pagedepth
\bye
\end{teXXX}

You can also try it with a \latex minimal and will produce the same output.


\section{The height of a box of text}

Following the literature we denote the value of |\baselineskip| (which is normally 12pt) by $b$. 
A
large |\vbox| with text consists mainly of lines of
text, each an |\hbox|, separated by globs of glue,
normally in the (varying) amounts necessary to
separate baselines by exactly $b$, but sometimes just
the amount |\lineskip|. We assume a simple case
where no large characters or equations are used. In
such a case, all lines of text are separated by $b$. The
height of the box is thus:
\begin{gather}
b(n - 1) + \text{the height of the first line}
\end{gather}
where $n$ is the number of text lines. Remember that the first line is a special case and adjustments can be made using the value of |\topskip|.

\section{The height of \texttt{\textbackslash box255}}

In the case of \docAuxCommand{box}255,
enough glue is placed above the first line of text
to reach to |\topskip| from the first baseline. We
denote the value of |\topskip| by $h$ (10pt in plain).
So if the baseline of the first line is now h below the
top of the page, the height H of |\box255| should
be b(n - 1) + h (Fig. 3). However, the height of
|\box255| is always set, by the page builder, to
|\vsize|. The difference between the two heights is
usually supplied by the flexible glues on the page,
the most common of which is |\parskip|

\subsection{Dead cycles.} An execution of the OTR without shipping any material is called a \emph{dead cycle}. Dead cycles, have their uses and we will explain this a bit later on. However, long iterations that just return \textit{dead cycles} is an indication of an error somewhere. \tex counts the number of dead cycles in a counter named |\deadcycles| and stops the run if |\deadcycles >= \maxdeadcycles|.  In the \textit{plain} format |\maxdeadcycles| is set as 25 and in \latex as \the\deadcycles. |\maxdeadcycles = 100| is \the\maxdeadcycles. Each time |\shipout| is invoked, it resets |\deadcycles| to zero.

\begin{dispListing}
If the file is not included, reset \deadcycles, so that a long list of non-included
files does not generate an `Output loop' error.
115 \deadcycles\z@
116 \@nameuse{cp@#1}%
117 \fi
118 \let\@auxout\@mainaux}
\end{dispListing}


\subsection{\tex's Page Number.} The page number can come from any source. Salomon provides an example where the \textsc{OTR} typesets a page number from a |\count| variable. This is typeset centered below the printed area.

%\newpage
%
%Test
%\makeatletter
%
%\let\ltxxoutput\output
%\let\ltxlabel\label@name
%\output={{\let\label@name\@gobble
%  \shipout\vbox{
%  \box255\smallskip
%  \centerline{\thepage}}}
%}
%
%\vfill \penalty-10000
%
%\global\let\output\ltxxoutput
%\let\label@name\ltxlabel
%
%
%\makeatother


Notice that the output macro, just passes the contents of the box to |\shipout|. This is not actually a very good method, but is shown here to illustrate a point.

Note the |\tenrm| in the preceding example. It
is necessary because of the asynchronous nature of
the \otr. When the \otr is invoked, \tex can be
anywhere on the next page. Specifically, it could
be inside a group where a different font is used.
Without the |\tenrm|, that font (the current font)
would be used in the otr.
In the plain format, the |\count0| variable
serves as the page number, and the following two
macros are especially useful.




\subsection{The \texttt{\textbackslash vsplit} operation.} 

Supposed you have inserted the material required to go on a page on a big |\vbox|, but the material is a bit extra that what is required to fill a page exactly. You would need an operation to split the box in two. The |vsplit| operation does that. It is important to the understanding of OTR operations to have an intimate knowledge of |\vsplit|. Its syntax is: 

\begin{quote}
|\vsplit|\meta{box number} to \meta{dim}
\end{quote}

The result of the operation is a box. Most often it appears in an assignment such as: 

\begin{quote}
|\setbox1=\vsplit0 to2.6in| 
\end{quote}

This sets |\box1| to a
height of 2.6in, moves material from the top of
|\box0| to |\box1|, and keeps the remainder in |\box0|.

\begin{macro}{\loremlines}
It is important to remember that most of \tex's commands work with \latex as well. In Example~\ref{ex:loremlines}, we define a box to hold |lipsum| text in a two column layout. We want to define a macro that can split the box in as many lines as we require. 
\end{macro}

\begin{texexample}{Splitting a vbox}{ex:loremlines}
\newbox\one
\newbox\two
\long\gdef\loremlines#1#2{%
   \setbox\one=\vbox {#2}
   \setbox\two=\vsplit\one to #1\baselineskip
   \unvbox\two
   \gdef\boxone{#2}
}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\small
\loremlines{16}{\onepar}
\end{multicols}
\boxone

\setbox\one=\vbox{100}
\the\ht\one \\
\the\baselineskip
\the\splittopskip

\end{texexample}


\tex assumes that the new |\box1| may have to
be shipped out as part of the page. It therefore
places a glue similar to $h$ at the top of |\box1|.
This glue is called \docAuxCommand{splittopskip} and has a plain
format value of 10pt [348].

One important thing to note is that a box can only be split \textit{between} lines of text. 
If we split a box to another size, |\box1| will come out underfull.

Here is an \otr which splits the page, ships
out the top part and returns the rest to the MVL
(actually, to the recent contributions):

\begin{teXXX}
\output={\setbox0=\vsplit255 to1in
\shipout\box0 \unvbox255}
\end{teXXX}






\section{Communicating with the OTR: Marks}


The user can pass information to the output routine through \textit{marks}. Marks have the syntax

\begin{teX}
\mark{mark text}
\end{teX}

which is put in a mark item on the current vertical list. The mark text is subject to expansion
as in \cs{edef}.
If the mark is given in horizontal mode it migrates to the surrounding vertical lists like an
insertion item (see page Text By Topic 77); however, if this is not the external vertical list, the output routine
will not find the mark.

Marks are the main mechanism through which the output routine can obtain information
about the contents of the currently broken-off page, in particular its top and bottom. TEX sets
three variables:

{\obeylines
\cs{botmark} the last mark occurring on the current page;
\cs{firstmark} the first mark occurring on the current page;
\cs{topmark} the last mark of the previous page, that is, the value of \cs{botmark} on the previous
page.
}



If no marks have occurred yet, all three are empty; if no marks occured on the current page, all three variables are equal to the \cs{botmark} of the previous page. 

Marks can be used to get a section heading into the headline or footline of the page.

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\def\section#1{ ... \mark{#1} ... }
\def\rightheadline{\hbox to \hsize
    {\headlinefont \botmark\hfil\pagenumber}}
\def\leftheadline{\hbox to \hsize
   {\headlinefont \pagenumber\hfil\firstmark}}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

This places the title of the first section that starts on a left page in the left
headline, and the title of the last section that starts on the right page in
the right headline. Placing the headlines on the page is the job of the output
routine; see below.

It is important that no page breaks can occur in between the mark and the
box that places the title:

\emphasis{mark,nobreak}
\begin{teXXX}
\def\section#1{ ...
   \penalty\beforesectionpenalty
   \mark{#1}
   \hbox{ ... #1 ...}
   \nobreak
   \vskip\aftersectionskip
   \noindent}
\end{teXXX}

%%%%%%%%%%%% macro to put TeX references in right margin %%%%%%%% 
\newdimen\theight 
\def \TeXref#1{% 
             \vadjust{\setbox0=\hbox{\sevenrm\quad\quad\TeX book: #1}% 
             \theight=\ht0 
             \advance\theight by \dp0    \advance\theight by \lineskip 
             \kern -\theight \vbox to \theight{\rightline{\rlap{\box0}}% 
             \vss}% 
             }}% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
 
However, useful these marks, sometimes an output routine (such as those found in \latexe needs to know why it was invoked. Knuth discusses in the \TeXref{396}  another method
that involves the value of the |\outputpenalty|. 
By testing for this value, it is possible to see what penalty occurred at a breakpoint;
any penalty of −10000, −10001, −10002, or less, forces the output routine to
act, hence different penalty values can be used to pass different messages. (When
the output routine puts material back on the list of contributions, it need not restore
the penalty at the breakpoint.) If output has been forced by a highly negative value
of |\outputpenalty|, the output routine can use |\vbox{\unvcopy255}| to discover how
full the page-so-far actually is. Underfull and overfull boxes are not reported when
|\box255| is packaged for use by the output routine, so there’s no harm in ejecting a
page prematurely if you want to pass a signal. (Set |\holdinginserts| positive to pass
a signal when the contents of |\box255| will be sent back through the page builder again,
if any insertions are present.)

Knuth also suggested another method that he called the \emph{dirtiest trick of all} that uses the depth 
of |\box255|. 

\section{Insertions}
Insertions are considered one of  the most  complex  topics in \tex. Many users master  topics  such 
as tokens,  file  I/O, macros,  and  even  OTRS  before they dare  tackle  insertions.  The  reason  is  that 
insertions  are  complex,  and  The \texbook, while 
covering all the relevant material, is somewhat cryptic regarding  insertions, and  lacks  simple examples. 
The  main  discussion  of  insertions takes  place  on 
[115-1251.  where \tex' s  registers  are also discussed. 
Examples  of  insertions are  shown, mostly  without 
explanations,  on  [363-364,  423-424].  A lot of what is described here is based on an article in TUGboat by David Salomon\footnote{\protect\url{http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb11-4/tb30salomon.pdf}}

Many users understand the idea of floats. Certain material to be typeset needs to be held in a buffer and inserted at different points on a page, for example a a figure that does not fit on a page it has to be inserted at the top of the next page. An \textit{insertion} is just a piece of a document that is generated at a certain point but appears at another point. Common examples are figures, footnotes and endnotes. Quoting Knuth:

\begin{quote}
  This  algorithm  is  admittedly  complicated, 
but  no  simpler  mechanism  seems  to  do  nearly 
as  much.
\end{quote}

\section{\protect\textbackslash shipout}

The primitive control sequence \docAuxCommand{shipout} is \tex's end game. It's syntax is quite simple:

\begin{quote}
|\shipout<box>|
\end{quote}

From TeXbook, Chapter 23: Output Routines, page 254:

\begin{quotation}
TeX’s primitive command |\shipout<box>| is what actually causes output. It sends the contents of the box to the dvi file, which is TeX’s main output file; after TeX has finished, the dvi file will contain a compact device-independent encoding of instructions that specify exactly what should be printed. When a box is shipped out, TeX displays the values of |\count0| through |\count9| on your terminal, as explained in Chapter 15; these ten counters are also recorded in the dvi file, where they can be used to identify the page. All of the |\openout, \closeout|, and |\write| commands that appear inside of the box are performed in their natural order as that box is being shipped out. Since a |\write| command expands macros, as explained in Chapter 21, TeX’s scanning mechanism might detect syntax errors while a |\shipout| is in progress. If  |\tracingoutput| is nonzero at the time of a \cs{shipout}, the contents of the box being shipped are written into your log file in symbolic form. You can say \cs{shipout} anywhere, not only in an output routine.
\end{quotation}


We can say:

\emphasize{shipout,vbox}
\begin{teXXX}
\shipout\vbox{%
  \hrule
  \medskip
  \lipsum[1-5]
  \medskip
  
  This is a Test for shipout
  
  \hrule
}
\end{teXXX}

\shipout\vbox{%
  \hrule
  \medskip
  \lipsum[1-5]
  \medskip
  \centering
  \textbf{Sample: }{This is a Test for shipout}
  \hrule
}

Since the output box handled by \tex still holds material the page is shown in the previous page. There is no page numbers or headers and it just shows he lorem-ipsum text and a primitive caption at the bottom. I have written the example to show the difference between the logical and actual pages. TeX does not care how the page will look, it will assemble it put headers, page numbers and pass it on to shipout. Shipout will then insert it to the dvi file, which will hold all teh instructions to print a real page.

We can modify the example to add our head and foot. 

\begin{texcode}{Shipout}{ex:ship2}
This will print by the normal routine

\long\gdef\boxit#1#2{\hbox{\vrule \vbox{\hrule\kern#2pt\hbox{%
\kern#2pt\vbox{#1}\kern#2pt}\kern#2pt\hrule}\vrule}}

\makeatletter
\shipout\vbox {%
  \vskip\topsep\relax
  \vskip\headsep
   \@thehead
   \vskip30pt
    \boxit{
      \lipsum[1-5]
      }{2}
   \vskip30pt
   \@thefoot   
}
\makeatother 
\end{texcode}

\latexe's output routine takes care of all the page geometry, the details to set up the headers and footers, but most importantly intercepts teh contents of the output box measure it, cuts it inserts the inserts such as footnotes and figures, margin notes, separates the text in two columns if necessary and so on. 

\long\gdef\boxit#1#2{\hbox{\vrule \vbox{\hrule\kern#2pt\hbox{%
\kern#2pt\vbox{#1}\kern#2pt}\kern#2pt\hrule}\vrule}}
\makeatletter
\shipout\vbox {%
  \vskip\topsep\relax
  \vskip\headsep
   \@thehead
   \vskip30pt
    \boxit{
      \lipsum[1-5]
      }{2}
   \vskip30pt
   \@thefoot   
}
\makeatother 



An output routine will prepare the virtual page and pass it onto a 

Here is an OTR for a \textit{framed} page. It surrounds the
page with double rules on all sides, and centers the
page number below the double box. Note that the
page shipped out is wider and taller than \cs{box255}.
The value of \cs{hsize} in this case is, therefore, not
the width of the final page shipped out, but the
width of the text lines in \cs{box255}.

Macro \cs{frameit} typesets text and surrounds it
with 4 rules (see [Ex. 21.3]). Parameter \#2 is the
space between the rules and the text. \#1 is a box
containing the text.

\emphasis{output,shipout}
\begin{texcode}{Example of simple output routine}{ex:output1}
\def\frameit#1#2{%
 \vbox{\hrule
  \hbox{%
    \vrule \kern#2pt
      \vbox{\kern#2pt #1
         \kern#2pt}%
      \kern#2pt\vrule}
\hrule}}

\output={
   \shipout\vbox{
   \boxit{\frameit{\box255}9}
      \medskip
      \centerline{Test Framed Page}}
  \advancepageno}
\end{texcode}

 

So far we did not care if the height of the page is right or not. In production code the shipout holds
a box, which has been produced by \tex. Any material we add to it, must not affect the dimensions of the box.
If we do and is too big the drivers will probably clip it.


Plain TeX has an output routine that takes care of  simple things like page numbering and insertions
using \cs{footnote} and \cs{topinsert}. 


So far we have examined the \tex OTR in detail. I hope it has given you enough understanding, not only to write your own output routine, but also to now be ready to study the \latex output routine, which is much more complicated. We have so far seen that  when \tex 
is typesetting pages of continuous text, it will gather material until it can find a least-cost page break intended to
make the gathered material fit the \cs{pagegoal} size. The
gathered material will then be placed into |\box255| and
the output routine stored in the token register \cs{output}
will be processed in a group of its own. 

Usually it will
arrange the gathered material in some way, add headers,
footlines and page numbers, and ship the gathered results out in typeset form with the \cs{shipout} command.
At the time of the \cs{shipout} command all \cs{open} and
\cs{write} commands stored in the box shipped out are expanded and written out. This is what makes it possible to have page labels corresponding to the actual page
numbers at the time of shipout: the corresponding info
is written to the |.aux| file at that time.
The output routine may decide to place material
back on the main vertical list instead of shipping it out. Its ob is to check if it can have a break, if it can it will ship the page out. If it cannot it will palce the material back on the main vertical list. 

\section{\LaTeX\  output routines}


\LaTeX\ output routine is described in \texttt{ltoutput.dtx}. You should also have a look at \texttt{ltfloat.dtx}. The algorithm is revisited i \latex3 and Frank Mittelbach, published a paper
\footnote{\protect\url{http://www.latex-project.org/papers/xo-pfloat.pdf}} in which he explains some of the problems facing the team, when dealing with the output routine.


Information on the output routine is rather scarce. Best source is a series of  articles in the TUGBoat by David Salomon.

David Kastrup's article \href{http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb24-3/kastrup.pdf}{Output Routine Requirements for Advanced Typesetting Tasks} (Proceedings of EuroTEX 2003) otlined some of the difficult areas and specifications for generic routines

The standard blocks are well described above and most tasks could be accomplished 
by rather working from
standard building blocks like \textit{insertion lists}, \textit{here points},
default mechanisms for \textit{margin notes} and so on.


%\section{Calling the output routine}

%\subsection{Float boxes and lists.} 
%A \textit{float list} consisting of the 
%floats in boxes |\boxa ... \boxN| has
%the form:
%
%|\@elt \boxa ... \@elt \boxN|
%where |\boxI| is defined by
%
%|\newinsert\boxI|
%
%Normally, |\@elt| is |\let| to |\relax|. A test can be performed on the
%entire 
%oat list by locally |\def|'ing |\@elt| appropriately and
%executing the list.
%This is a lot more efficient than looping through the list.
%\LaTeX\ defines float boxes as |bx@A| to |bx@R| to make them available for 
%inserts. These will be used later to define the lists that hold these boxes. 
%
%\latex now defines the float boxes. Each one is defined as an \cmd{\newinsert.}

%Note the |\newpage| is defined a bit further on. This is a fairly simple definition, since most of the code that follows only gets a bit complicated with the twocolumn option.

%\section{The output macro}
%
%The setting of the \cs{output} is quite short but it belies its complexity.
%After having checked verious parameters it redirects to |@specialoutput|. This is the heart of the routines. Notice that \latex just fills in the token list of \tex's |output| routine, it does not attempt to redefine it or save it. 
%Should some hooks be defined here, life might have been made easier, however, what one can do is to first save the \latex output routine and then redefine the output as one may wish. Return to it can happen after it. If you take this approach, you should be careful of packages that redefine output, such as |multicol| and |longtable|. An approach such as this is taken by \citeauthor{revtex} in the \pkgname{revtex} class.\footcite[][This is a document class of the American Physical Society. It enables submission to any of the APS journals. Its distribution point is \protect\url{http://publish.aps.org/revtex4/}]{revtex}

\section{Packages}

OTR routines are notoriously difficult to debug and define. Some of the available packages at CTAN
can make the programming job easier.

The \pkg{everypage} package by Sergio Callegari provides hooks into the \latex\ internal commands to
to do actions on every page or on the current page. Specifically, actions  are performed \emph{before} the page is shipped, so they can be used to put watermarks \emph{in the background} of a page, or to
set the page layout. 

The package provides two hooks:

\emphasis{AddEverypageHook,AddThisPageHook}
\begin{teXXX}
  \AddEverypageHook{Test}
  \AddThisPageHook
\end{teXXX}

The package reminds in some sense
\pkgname{bobhook} by Karsten Tinnefeld, but it differs in the way in
 which the hooks are implemented, as detailed in the following.
 In some sense it may also be related to the package
 \pkgname{everyshi} by Martin Schroeder, but again the implementation
 is different.

 
 This program adds two \LaTeX\ hooks that get run when document
 pages are finalized and output to the |.dvi| or |.pdf|
 file. Specifically, one hook gets executed on every page, while the
 other is executed for the current page. Hook actions are are performed
 \emph{before} the page is output on the medium, and this is
 important to be able to play with the page layout or to put things
 \emph{behind} the page contents (e.g., watermarks such as an image,
 framing, the ``DRAFT'' word, and the like).
 
 The package reminds in some sense \pkg{bobhook} by Karsten
 Tinnefeld, but it differs in the way in which the hooks are
 implemented:
 


 \begin{enumerate}
 \item there is no formatting inherent in the hooks. If one wants to
   put some watermark on a page, it is his own duty to put in the
   hook the code to place the watermark in the right position. Also
   note that the hooks code should \emph{eat up no space} in the
   page.  Again, if the hooks are meant to place some material on the
   page, it is the duty of the hook programmer to put code in the
   hooks to pretend that the material has zero width and zero height.
   The implementation is \emph{lighter} than the \Lpack{bobhook} one,
   and possibly more flexible, since one is not limited by any
   pre-coded formatting for the hooks. On the other hand it is
   possibly more difficult to use. Nonetheless, it is easy to think
   of other packages relying on \Lpack{everypage} to deliver more
   user-friendly and \emph{task specific} interfaces. Already there
   are a couple of them: the package \Lpack{flippdf} produces
   mirrored pages in a PDF document and \Lpack{draftwatermark}
   watermarks document pages.
 \item similarly to \Lpack{bobhook} and \Lpack{watermark}, the
   package relies on the manipolatoin of the internal \LaTeX\ macro
   |\@begindvi| to do the job. However, the redefinition of
   |\@begindvi| is here postponed as much as possible, striving to
   avoid interference with other packages using |\AtBeginDvi| or
   anyway manipulating |\@begindvi|. Specifically \Lpack{everypage}
   makes no special assumption on the initial code that |\@begindvi|
   might contain.
 \end{enumerate}



Also in some sense \pkgname{everypage} can be related to package
 \pkgname{everyshi} by Martin Schr\"oeder \cite{everyshi}, but it differs radically from
 it in the implementation. In fact,\pkgname{everypage} operates by
 manipulation of the |\@begindvi| macro, rather than at the
 lower level |\shipout| macro.

\section{hooking at shipout}

\begin{docCmd} {EveryShipout} {}
\begin{docCmd} {AtNextShipout} {}
This package provides the hooks \cs{EveryShipout} and 
  \cs{AtNextShipout} whose arguments are executed after the output 
  routine has constructed \cs{box255}, and before \cs{shipout} is 
  called.
\end{docCmd}
\end{docCmd}

An example application for this package would be a package for
 adding text to the bottom of each page.
 The  \pkgname{prelim2e} package adopts this method \citep{prelim2e}.\footcite{prelim2e}

The solution  uses is based on code developed in  |quire.tex| by
 Marcel R.~van der Goot.\footcite{quire}  

The \pkgname{prelim2e}  intercepts and modifies the |\box255|. 

\begin{teX}
44 \newcommand{\@Prelim@EveryShipout}{%
45 \bgroup
% First we save the dimensions of \box255: height, width and depth; and calculate
% the total height of \box255.
46 \dimen\z@=\wd\@cclv
47 \dimen\@ne=\ht\@cclv
48 \dimen\tw@=\dp\@cclv
49 \dimen\thr@@=\dimen1
50 \advance\dimen\thr@@ by \dimen\tw@
% Then we set \box255: A \vbox to the total height of \box255. In this a \hbox to
% the width of \box255 is included, in which \box255 is set.
51 \global\setbox\@cclv\vbox to \dimen\thr@@{%
52 \hb@xt@\dimen\z@{%
53 \box\@cclv%
54 \hss
55 }%
\end{teX}
To this we append the text produced by |\PrelimText|. It is put in a |\vbox to 0pt|
in which a |\hbox| to the width of |\box255| is included, in which |\PrelimText| is set.
We have to reset |\protect| because it is set to |\noexpand| by the output routine.

\begin{teXXX}
56 \vbox to \z@{%
57   \hb@xt@\dimen\z@{%
58     \let\protect\relax
59     \hfill\PrelimText\hfill
60   }%
61   \vss
62 }%
63   \vss
64 }%
\end{teXXX}

Finally we set the dimensions of |\box255| to the values they had before |\@Prelim@EveryShipout|.

Once the command is defined, it is hooked into the system via |\EveryShipout| when it is in draft mode. 

\begin{teX}
70 \if@prelim@draft
71 \EveryShipout{\@Prelim@EveryShipout}
72 \fi
\end{teX}

\section{How to place a background image}

One can use \tikzname to place a background image or some text on a page

First we define some utility macros:


\begin{teX}
\def\bg@contents{Draft}
\def\bg@color{red!45}
\def\bg@angle{60}
\def\bg@opacity{.5}
\def\bg@scale{15}
\def\bg@position{current page.center}
\def\bg@anchor{}
\def\bg@hshift{0}
\def\bg@vshift{0}
\end{teX}

A new command is then developed to describe the background material

\begin{teXXX}
\newcommand\bg@material{%
   \begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture,overlay]
   \node [rotate=\bg@angle,scale=\bg@scale,opacity=\bg@opacity,%
   xshift=\bg@hshift,yshift=\bg@vshift,color=\bg@color]
   at (\bg@position) [\bg@anchor] {\bg@contents};
  \end{tikzpicture}}%
\end{teXXX}


Once the background material has been defined we can place it on the page by simply calling:

\begin{teX}
\newcommand\BgThispage{\AddThispageHook{\bg@material}}
\end{teX}


The \pkgname{background}\footcite{background} package by \citeauthor has capitalized on two good packages the \tikzname and the \pkgname{everypage}.
\footcite{everypage} As most of modern
\tex programming works with |pdf| files, package developers prefer to use \tikzname methods for hooking directly into the pdf and thus avoid a trip into the output routine. If it is required then it hooks via the dvi or shipout commands.\footnote{These packages are loaded automatically by the \pkgname{phd-pkgmanager}.}
