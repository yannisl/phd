\chapter{Setting up Fonts}
\label{ch:fonts}
\section{Introduction}
\pagestyle{headings}
\index{fonts>serif}\index{fonts>non-serif}
Selecting the right fonts for a book is a job best left to the book designer. Despise this good advice most \latex authors get their hands dirty trying to play the role of the book designer. A word of advice is that most of them make a royal mess of it. Irrespective of the \tex engine employed, being \tex, \latexe, \lualatex or \xelatex there are two issues in using fonts. How to select them and specify them and what fonts to use. We will dwell on the technical aspects of font selection in this Chapter.

There is another more serious aspect in selecting fonts based on ``physiological’’ considerations. Boris Veytsman in an article in TUGboat \citep{boris2012} reviewed the literature comparing fonts for readbility as well as the ``trustability'' of the text based on different fonts. Experiments carried out by Morris \footcite{morris2012a} concluded that fonts affect the reader's attitude towards the text. Baskerville scored the highest and Comic Sans the lowest.
Interestingly Computer Modern, the default typeface of \tex, scored high in the test.  Other tests carried out by \cite{boris2012a} also concluded that there are no noticable differences between serif and non-serif fonts in reading comprehension for cyrillic adult readers and that comprehension and reading speed might be affected by factors other than the font serifs alone. 

Of course the biggest effect on readers is when fonts are used for ``branding'' a product into consumers minds. 
Marketers have been brainwashing
consumers for years through the use of fonts. In \textit{Branding
With Type}  by Rogener, Pool, and Packhauser
(1995), a fervent argument is made for unique
but consistent typefaces as a crucial element of
corporate branding. Rogener et al. describe the
fonts used by IBM, Mercedes, Nivea, and
Marlboro as instantly recognisable
internationally, and imply that the significant
investment by such companies in design and
copyright of trademarked fonts is worthwhile. 

For example, \citeauthor{rogener1995} discuss the Nivea
Bold typeface developed in 1992 by Gunther
Heinrich at advertising agency \textsc{TBWA} in
Hamburg, Germany, for skincare brand Nivea,
and claim that the Nivea Bold typeface has
effectively embodied the Nivea brand’s `pure
and simple’ product philosophy. They link the
font directly to profitability and Nivea’s
worldwide product category market share of
35\% \footcite[p. 91]{rogener1995} 


\section{The Choice of Typesetting Engine}

If you use only |pdfLaTeX| the range of fonts is rather limiting and I would highly recommend for any serious typesetting work to move onto |XeLaTeX| and the use of the package \pkg{fontspec} \citep{fontspec}. Another alternative is to use \lualatex. The latter is becoming more stable and is production ready to a large extend. It is expected to be the successor to pdfTeX.

One of the things I wanted to achieve with the \pkgname{phd} package was  to take care of different \tex engines, and to ensure that the package can be used irrespective of the \TeX\ engine used. 

Before we start outlining the scheme let us start, by demonstrating how to load one of the standard fonts provided by \latexe. We will load the Computer Modern font.\index{Computer Modern (font)} 

\begin{texexample}{How to load a font}{ex:fonts}
\newcommand{\fontdemo}[4][OT1]{
    \leavevmode
    \textcolor{thefontname}{#2}
    \fontencoding{#1}\fontfamily{#3}\selectfont#4 }
\bgroup
\fontdemo{CM}{cmtt}{ \alphabet\par}

\fox
\egroup

\centerline{\sl    by A. U. Thor} % !`?`?! (modified)
\vskip .5cm
Once upon a time, in a distant
  galaxy called \"O\"o\c c,
there lived a computer
named R.~J. Drofnats.

he preferred to be called---% error has been fixed!

\meaning\ttdefault 
\end{texexample}

In the example we have used a number of convenience commands that are provided by the |phd| package.

\begin{docCmd} {alphabet} {}
  Typesets the letters of the English alphabet
\end{docCmd}  


\begin{docCmd}{fox}{}
  Typesets the fox passage
\end{docCmd}

The example  creates a convenience command to call the |computer modern typewriter| font and to print the alphabet.\footnote{The command \cs{alphabet} is provided by the \texttt{phd} package.} In this case we are asking \latex to load a font from the |cmtt| family. 

To load a font two things are required the encoding scheme [|OT1|] in the example and the somewhat cryptic font family name [|cmtt|].

\section{What is a character? And a glyph?}
\index{glyph}\index{character}
A character is an abstract
concept: the letter “A” is a character, while any
particular drawing of that character is a glyph. In many
cases there is one glyph for each character and one character
for each glyph, but not always.

The glyph used for the Latin letter “A” may also be
used for the Greek letter “Alpha”, while in Arabic writing
most Arabic letters have at least four different glyphs
(often vastly more) depending on what other letters are
around them.

\section{What's a font?}

As the \pkgname{fontinst} manual says: ``Once upon a time, this question was easily answered: a font is a set of type
in one size, style, etc. There used to be no ambiguity, because a font was a
collection of chunks of type metal kept in a drawer, one drawer for each font'' \citet{fontinst}.


With digital typesetting, things are more complicated. What a font
\textit{is} isn't easy to pin down. A typical use of a PostScript font with \latex might
use these elements:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Type 1 printer font file
\item Bitmap screen font file
\item Adobe font metric file (afm file)
\item \tex font metric file (tfm file)
\item Virtual font file (vf file)
\item font definition file (fd file)
\end{enumerate}

Looked at from a particular point of view, each of these files \textit{is} the font. So
what’s going on? Every text font in \latex has five attributes:

\index{encoding schemes>OML}\index{encoding schemes>OMS}\index{encoding schemes>OMX}\index{encoding schemes>U}\index{encoding schemes>OML}
\index{encoding schemes}\index{encoding schemes>OT1}



\section{The low-level interface}

The low level commands are mainly  used to define new commands in packages and classes.
It is helpful to understand the internal organization of fonts in \latex's font selection
scheme New Font Selection Scheme (NFSS). Although termed new, one needs to understand
that this is now almost twenty years old.

One of the goals of \latex's font selection scheme was to allow a rational selection with
algorithms guided by the principles of generic markup \citep{companion}. 

Internally the \latex kernel keeps track of five independent attributes. The ``current encoding",
the ``current family'', the ``current series'', the ``current shape'', and the ``current size''. This was introduced in NFSS release 2 after it became clear that real support in multiple languages would be possible only by maintaining the character-encoding scheme independly of the
other font attributes.


\subsection{Encoding Schemes}

The \textit{encoding} scheme (in the example |OT1|) provides information as to which glyph goes into what slot in a font table. These font tables can be printed using |fonttest.tex|. We show the test for |cmtt10| in Figure~\ref{fig:fonttest}. The
most common values for the font encoding are:
\medskip

\begin{longtable}{ll}
OT1   & TEX text\\
T1     & TEX extended text\\
OML  & TEX math italic\\
OMS  & TEX math symbols\\
OMX  & TEX math large symbols\\
U       & Unknown\\ 
L\meta{xx}  &A local encoding\\
\end{longtable}
\medskip
\begin{description}
\item[family]\index{fonts>family}\index{fonts>cmr}\index{fonts>cmss}
\index{fonts>cmtt}
The name for a collection of fonts, usually grouped under a common
name by the font foundry. For example, `Adobe Times', `ITC Garamond',
and Knuth's `Computer Modern Roman' are all font families.

There are far too many font families to list them all, but some common ones
are:

\begin{longtable}{rl}
cmr  &Computer Modern Roman\\
cmss &Computer Modern Sans\\
cmtt &Computer Modern Typewriter\\
cmm  &Computer Modern Math Italic\\
cmsy &Computer Modern Math Symbols\\
cmex &Computer Modern Math Extensions\\
ptm  &Adobe Times\\
phv  &Adobe Helvetica\\
pcr  &Adobe Courier\\
\end{longtable}

\item[series] How heavy or expanded a font is. For example, `medium weight', `narrow'
and `bold extended' are all series.

\item[shape] The form of the letters within a font family. For example, `italic',
`oblique' and `upright' (sometimes called `roman') are all font shapes. The most common values for the font shape are:

\begin{longtable}{ll}
n  &Normal (that is `upright' or `roman')\\
it &Italic\\
sl &Slanted (or `oblique')\\
sc &Caps and small caps\\
ui & upright italic shape\\
ol &  ouline shape\\
\end{longtable}

To change the shape attribute the \docAuxCmd{fontshape} is used to change the shape
attribute. If you try this and it does not work, it means that the font you have selected
does not have the font shape you have requested. You may need to specify an appropriate
font family as well:

\begin{texexample}{usefont}{ex:usefont}
{\usefont{T1}{cmr}{m}{sc}  \raggedright \lorem}
\end{texexample}

\item[size] The design size of the font, for example `10pt'. If no dimension is specified, `pt' is assumed.
\end{description}

These five parameters specify every \latex
font, for example:

\begin{longtable}{lll}
|LaTeX| specification &Font  &TEX font name\\
|OT1 cmr m n 10|      &Computer Modern Roman 10 point &cmr10\\
|OT1 cmss m sl 1pc|   &Computer Modern Sans Oblique 1 pica &cmssi12\\
|OML cmm m it 10pt|   &Computer Modern Math Italic 10 point &cmmi10\\
|T1 ptm b it 1in|  &Adobe Times Bold Italic 1 inch &ptmb8t at 1in\\
\end{longtable}

\begin{texexample}{Th usefont command}{ex:usefont}
\bgroup
\fontsize{12}{14pt} \lorem
\lorem
\egroup
\end{texexample}

When you get a font error or an underfull or overfull box \tex always will print an error with the font specification in full as shown below:

\begin{verbatim}
LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `EU1/cmr/m/sc' undefined
(Font)              using `EU1/cmr/m/n' instead on input line 160.
\end{verbatim}

\section{Setting several font attributes}

Often it is required that several attributes of a particular font need to be set. For this
task \latex provides the command \docAuxCmd{usefont}. This command takes four arguments: the encoding, family, series, and shape. The command updates those and then calls \docAuxCmd{selectfont}. If you also need to change the size and baseline skip, place
a \docAuxCmd{fontsize} command in front of it. 

\begin{texexample}{Th usefont command}{ex:usefont}
\bgroup
\fontsize{12}{14pt}\usefont{OT1}{cmdh}{bc}{it}
\lorem
\egroup
\end{texexample}

Do note that when you use the \pkgname{hyperref}, you will get a surprise, all the commands have been converted to "PU" encoding. This is mostly harmless and is  done in order for |hyperref| to mark bookmarks\footnote{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/198810/why-does-the-hyperref-package-changes-encoding-of-font-commands} in a safe way.

\meaning\NG\\
\meaning\k\\

\meaning\printfontparams

\printfontparams
\end{texexample}

A peek at the \docFile{puenc.def} reveals the inner workings
of the encoding mechanism.

\begin{phdverbatim}

\latex uses a number of other files to get to the particular file that contains the font metrics file |cmtt10| and to find the appropriate file. For the original Knuth fonts the filenames have been kept the same, essentially as a request from Knuth that one should not change them.

Most of the difficulty in selecting and using fonts is figuring the encoding scheme and the Karl Berry naming scheme. In the Example~\ref{ex:fonts} we select the \cs{fontfamily} |cmtt| which is computer modern type writer and then we invoke the macros for the shape \cs{itshape} and print the |alphabet|. The macro \cmd{\alphabet} is build-in the |phd| package as we use it in a few places.

\subsection{The Postscript fonts}

With Adobe reader a number of fonts come pre-packaged and these have been incorporated into \latex2e. These fonts can be found in all \tex distributions. The \textit{Times New Roman} is named |ptm|. 

\begin{texexample}{The Postscript fonts}{ex:postscriptfonts}
\raggedright
\begin{tabular}{@{}>{\sffamily\bfseries}rl}
\fonttitle{The Adobe `LaserWriter 35', 10 typefaces in a total of 35

%\thefont{Avant Garde Book}{pag}{\fontsize{9}{9}\selectfont\sample}
%\thefont{Bookman Light}{pbk}{\sample}
\thefont{Courier}{pcr}{\sample}
\thefont{Helvetica}{phv}{\sample}
\thefont{New Century Schoolbook}{pnc}{\sample}
\thefont{Palatino}{ppl}{\sample}
\thefont[U]{Symbol}{psy}{\sample}
\thefont{Zapf Chancery Medium Italic}{pzc}{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont\itshape\sample}
\thefont[U]{Zapf Dingbats}{pzd}{\sample}
\end{tabular}
\end{texexample}

Using the |phd| package we can come closer to the |fontspec| or LuaTeX way of doing things and use longer font names as those found in the operating system.


Activating the key will set the font to |pzc| and unless is within a group
will typeset the rest of the document with this typeface.

\lettrine{G}{o}ats are among the earliest animals domesticated by humans. The most recent genetic analysis confirms the archaeological evidence that the wild Bezoar ibex of the Zagros Mountains are the likely origin of almost all domestic goats today. Neolithic farmers began to herd wild goats for easy access to milk and meat, primarily, as well as for their dung, which was used as fuel, and their bones, hair, and sinew for clothing, building, and tools. The earliest remnants of domesticated goats dating 10,000 years before present are found in Ganj Dareh in Iran. Goat remains have been found at archaeological sites in Jericho, Choga Mami Djeitun and Çay\"on\"u, dating the domestication of goats in Western Asia at between 8000 and 9000 years ago.\footnote{Text is from wikipedia's article for the domesticated goat.}

As you have observed we did not change the normal size of paragraphs, but the examples demonstrate that differences in font families also affect the visual size of the typeset text. |Helvetica| is normally scaled down to 0.95 and |Chancery| is scaled a little bit up or we use a larger font size.




\subsection{Additional free fonts for use with \LaTeX}

\section{Dingbat and Symbol Fonts}
\index{fonts>Zapf Dingbats}

Fonts containing collections of special symbols, which are normally not found in a text font, are called  \textit{dingbats}. One such font, the PostScript font Zapf Dingbats, is available if you use the |pifont| package, originally written by Sebastian Rahtz, and now part of |PSNFSS|. This is loaded automatically by the |phd| package. (See also implementation code at Page \pageref{dingbats}).

The parameter for the \cs{ding} command is an integer that specifies the character to be typeset according to Table~\ref{tbl:dingbats}. For example |\ding{38}| gives \ding{38}.

For Open Type fonts the |Wingdings| family can be found on Windows systems. The advent of Unicode and the universal character set allowed commonly used dingbats to be given their own character codes. Although fonts claiming Unicode coverage will contain glyphs for dingbats \textit{in addition} to alphabetic characters continue to be popular, primarily for ease of input. Such fonts are sometimes known as \textit{pi fonts}.\index{fonts>pi fonts}

\subsection{Unicode Dingbats block}

The Dingbats block |U+2700-U+27BF| was added to the Unicode Standard in June, 1993, with the release of version 1.1. This code block  contains decorative character variants, and other marks of emphasis and non-textual symbolism. Most of its characters were taken from Zapf Dingbats. 

The Ornamental Dingbats block (|U+1F650–U+1F67F|) was added to the Unicode Standard in June 2014 with the release of version 7.0. This code block contains ornamental leaves, punctuation, and ampersands, quilt squares, and checkerboard patterns. It is a subset of dingbat fonts Webdings, Wingdings, and Wingdings 2. \footnote{See \url{http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n4115.pdf}}

A font that we will be using for many of the \XeLaTeX examples is |code2000|
and |code2001|. The fonts were designed by James Kas
\footnote{They can be downloaded at \url{http://www.alanwood.net/downloads/index.html}}. They are True type fonts. The fonts contain a respectable collection of more or less exotic Unicode characters both within the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP). They were designed by James Kass and were freeware. Sadly the website is no longer available, but the files can be downloaded in the links I have provided. I have also included them in the distribution for the |phd| package, as they are such a useful tool.

The |Symbola Font| has many other symbols, including chess and even Mahjong symbols\index{Mahjong}.\footnote{\url{http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/Symbola.pdf}}. \person{George Douros} has packaged many of the fonts for archaic languages, but sadly the substitution mechanisms of \latexe do not always map the fonts properly.

With |LuaLaTeX| and |XeLaTeX|, \tex has moved into the twenty-first century and its usefulness can now be extended to many other languages and fields. 


\section{Naming digital fonts}

Commercial and Open Source fonts come as a set of several files. The |.pfb| file and less frequently, a |.pfa| file or other files depending on the type of font and the operating system and provider. The metric information file resides in an associated |.afm| file. Other files, with extensions |.inf| (information) and |.pfm| are irrelevant to \latex and \tex.

Fonts already have names given them by their designers. The problem lies in associating this name with the font files. Restriction of operating systems originally from PC-DOS dates, restricted to the initial part of file names to eight characters.

\subsection{Karl Berry naming scheme}\index{Karl Berry Scheme}\index{fonts>Karl Berry scheme}

The original inspiration for Fontname was Frank Mittelbach and Rainer Schoepf's article in TUGboat 11(2) (June 1990). This led to an article by Karl Berry in TUGboat 11(4) (November pages 512-519).

Karl Berry then suggested a system---with many limitations, but perhaps the best that could have been done in its time, for mapping a lengthy font name into a file name that was eight or fewer characters long. If the font files are renamed accordingly then we can deduce the nature of the font by examining its file name. The scheme did not apply to the original Computer Modern fonts that retained their original names \citep{fontname}.

This scheme assumes that only eight characters or fewer can be available for naming the font. These eight characters look like,

\begin{verbatim}
FNNW[S][V]7V
\end{verbatim}

Some additional comments on this shorthand notation is in order. 
The most common foundry abbreviations are |p| for Adobe (from PostScript), \textbf{b} for BitStream, and \textbf{m} Monotype. A font flouting this scheme will begin with a z.

The next two letters are reserved for the typeface name. The hundreds and hundred of available faces guarantees  that many of these will be cryptic, even for the most common typefaces---Adobe Garamond is |ad|. 





\section{The phd package interface.}

By design feature options for XeTeX/XeLaTeX have currently been restricted. The reason behind this decision is that I was concerned that I would have added a complicated interface with very little reason as to its use. I opted for a more semantic approach and expect the user to define custom macros to handle anything else.
\medskip

\keyval{mainfont}{\marg{font1,font2,font3}}{A comma separated list of one or more font-names. The main font will be set to the first font found.}
\keyval{chapterfont}{\marg{font1,font2,font3}}{A comma separated list of one or more font-names. The main font will be set to the first font found.}
\keyval{sectionfont}{\marg{font1,font2,font3}}{A comma separated list of one or more font-names. The main font will be set to the first font found.}
\keyval{contentsfont}{\marg{font1,font2,font3}}{A comma separated list of one or more font-names. The main font will be set to the first font found.}

\begin{docKey}[phd] {bibliography font}{ = \marg{font1,font2,font3}} {}
A comma separated list of one or more font-names. The main font will be set to the first font found.
\end{docKey}

Note that the package will first check if is running under XeTeX. If it does it will execute the commands and load the macros, otherwise it will fall back on pdfLaTeX commands.

\section{Discussion}


Unfortunately, even with the best will loading fonts will always be a difficult task in \TeX\. Hopefully the interface provided will result in better separation of presentation from content and offers consistency in the styling of documents. Nothing prevents you from adding normal macros to styles. Each style can be treated as a package in many respects.

\section{Utilities for testing fonts}

The package \pkg{fonttable} is an extension and re-implementation of Donald Knuth’s \docFile{testfont.tex}, which
is available from CTAN. The package was developed by \person {Peter}{Wilson} and currently maintained by \person{Will}{Robertson}\citep{fonttable}. It provides a number of utility commands for typesetting font tables.


The {fonttable}\marg{font} takes the font file as an  argument and typesets it in a nice table. 

% \ifengine
%\ifxetex
% \else
%  \fonttable{pzdr}
%\fi

A great tool to inspect a True Type font on the command line is \texttt{luaotfload-tool}:

\begin{teXXX}
  luaotfload-tool --find="Iwona" --inspect
\end{teXXX}

\section{ \texttt{.tfm } files}


When you tell \tex that you will be using a particular font, it has to find out information about that font. This information is stored in a file with the extension \docfileextension{.tfm}. For example when you say:

|\font a=cmr10|

\noindent \tex looks for  a file named |cmr10.tfm|. If this is not found then an error is issued |Lookup failed on file CMR10.TFM|

Generall speaking, a font's |.tfm| file contains information about the height, width and depth of all the characters in the font plus kerning and ligature information. So, |cmr10.tfm| might say that the lower-case "d" in CMR10 is 5.5 points wide, 6.94 points high, etc. This is the information that \tex uses to make its lowest-level boxes---those around characters. See the \tex manual for information about what \tex does with these boxes. Note the |.tfm| files do not contain any information that is device dependent. Only device-drivers read \tex's |dvi| output files can use that sort of information.


\section{Fonts for Far East Languages}

In internationalization, CJK is a collective term for the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages, all of which use Chinese characters and derivatives (collectively, CJK characters) in their writing systems. Occasionally, Vietnamese is included, making the abbreviation CJKV, since Vietnamese historically used Chinese characters as well.
The characters are known as hànzì in Chinese, kanji in Japanese, hanja in Korean, and Chữ Nôm in Vietnamese.\index{kanji}\index{hanja}\index{hànzì}\index{CJK}\index{CJKV}


\subsection{Selecting a font}

The easiest way is with Will Robertson's \pkgname{fontspec} package. In this sample, we have used the \texttt{SimSun} font, which can be found on windows machines:

\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setromanfont{SimSun}
\end{verbatim}
in the preamble, to use a Far Eastern font as the initial default typeface.

\section{Entering CJK text}

You can just enter Unicode text directly in the document: 你好. Don't use legacy \LaTeX\ packages such as \verb|inputenc| or \verb|CJK|, as \XeTeX\ reads the text as Unicode characters, not the separate byte codes of UTF-8 sequences, and passes them directly to the Unicode font. (Actually, it would probably be possible to use \verb|\XeTeXinputencoding "bytes"| and work with legacy \LaTeX\ input encoding support. But then you're pretty much committed to all the old encoding and font machinery, and there's not much point in using the \XeTeX\ engine at all.)


\begin{comment}
\setromanfont{Times New Roman}

\subsection{A CJK environment}

\newenvironment{CJK}{\fontspec[Scale=0.9]{SimSun}}{}

\newcommand{\cjk}[1]{{\fontspec[Scale=0.9]{SimSun}#1}}

Rather than selecting a CJK font as the main document typeface, you might want to define a CJK environment for text fragments used in the midst of a document using a normal Roman font. This allows me to say \verb|\begin{CJK}東光\end{CJK}| to generate \begin{CJK}東光\end{CJK}, without putting the whole paragraph into the Far Eastern font. Or I could define a command that takes the CJK text as an argument, so that \verb|\cjk{北京}| produces \cjk{北京}. It's that easy! Such an environment can easily be set using the \cmd{newfamily} or \cmd{\fontspec}.

\begin{verbatim}
\newenvironment{CJK}{\fontspec[Scale=0.9]{SimSun}}{}
\newcommand{\cjk}[1]{{\fontspec[Scale=0.9]{SimSun}#1}}
\end{verbatim}
\end{comment}

\section{Changing the font size in LaTeX}

\index{fonts>sizing commands}

Changing the font size in LaTeX can be done at two levels, 
affecting the whole document or elements with in it. 
Using a different font size on a
global level will affect all normal-sized text as well
as the sizes of headings, footnotes, etc. By changing
the font size locally, however, a single word, a few
lines of text, a large table, or a heading throughout
the document may be modified. Fortunately, there is
no need for the writer to juggle with numbers when
doing so. \latex provides a set of macros for changing
the font size locally, taking into consideration the
document’s global font size. \citep{thurnherr2012}

\subsection{Changing the font size on the document-wide level}

The standard classes article, report and book support
three different font sizes: 10pt, 11pt, 12pt. By
default, the font size is set to 10pt and can be modified
by passing any of the previously-mentioned
value as a class option. As an example, suppose you
want to change the font size for normal text to 12pt
throughout the document. For the class report, this
is how you would do that:

\begin{quote}
|\documentclass[12pt]{report}|
\end{quote}

In most cases, the available font sizes for the
standard classes are sufficient and you do not have to
bother about loading special packages that provide
more options.

\section{Changing the font size locally}

A common scenario is that the author of a document
needs to change the font size for a word or paragraph,
decrease the font size of a large table to make it fit on
a page or increase the size of a heading throughout
the document. LaTeX implements a set of macros
which allow changing font size from Huge to tiny,
literally. That way, the author does not have to
worry about numbers. The macros, including the
exact font size in points, are summarized in table 1.
A good rule of thumb is not to use too many
different sizes and not to make things too small or
too big.

\latexe provides two different ways to use these
font size modifier macros: inline or as an environment
using |\begin...\end|:

\begin{texexample}{Changing the size locally}{ex:size}
{\Large This is some large text.\par}
\begin{footnotesize}
This is some footnote-sized text.
\end{footnotesize}
\end{texexample}

The |\par| command at the end of the inline
example adjusts baselineskip, the minimum space
between the bottom of two successive lines



A number of packages exist \ctan{moresize} \citep{moresize},
 \ctan{anyfont} by \citeauthor{anyfont}. The standard classes, \docClass{memoir}
 \docClass{KOMA} classes and most journals also provide their own
 defined sizing commands.
