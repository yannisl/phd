\chapter{Listings styles}  

Many users of \latex require to typeset formatted code. There are two packages that
can be used the more conventional \pkgname{listings}\footcite{listings} and \pkgname{minted}\footcite{minted}. The
|minted| package is a more powerful and flexible package than listing, since it uses
an external program |Pygments| which is written in |Python|\footnote{See \protect\url{http://pygments.org/} for more details. You can also review and contribute to the code at \protect\url{https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main}}. My recommendation to you is
to use the |minted package|. The two packages can happily co-exist and each one has
its own advantages and disantvantages. The listings package has all its color
parameters configurable via its \latex key value settings, whereas the pygments program
has its own way of setting these styles, which are only accessible through \latex
as a set of fixed styles. To create a new color scheme, you will need to write some
simple |python|, register it as a plugin or drop it at the folder holding the styles.\footnote{See documentation at \protect\url{http://pygments.org/docs/styles/}.}

For me
it is the only limiting factor of pygments and which there are ways around it. However, this might be also an advantage
as users are more likely to be familiar with such code coloring schemes in their language.

\section{Using minted}

Since minted makes calls to the outside world (that is, Pygments), you need to
tell the \latex processor about this by passing it the |-shell-escape| option or it
wonâ€™t allow such calls. In effect, instead of calling the processor like this:

\usemintedstyle{friendly}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize,style=vim]{bash}
$ latex input
you need to call it like this:
$ latex -shell-escape input
\end{minted}

The same holds for other processors, such as pdf\latex or \xelatex.
You should be aware that using -shell-escape allows \latex to run potentially
arbitrary commands on your system. It is probably best to use -shell-escape
only when you need it, and to use it only with documents from trusted sources.

\subsection{A minimal example}   
 
The minted package is loaded like any other package (with or without options). 
You can then use the \docAuxEnv{minted} environment with the language we want to use
as the first argument. The environment also takes an optional argument where the numerous
settings of the package can be specified.
 
\begin{phdverbatim}[basicstyle=\small\ttfamily]
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{minted}
\begin{document}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize,style=friendly]{javascript}
if (Meteor.isClient) {
  // This code only runs on the client
  Template.body.helpers({
    tasks: [
      { text: "This is task 1" },
      { text: "This is task 2" },
      { text: "This is task 3" }
    ]
  });
}
\end{minted}
\end{document}
\end{phdverbatim}

This will produce an output as:
\medskip

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize,style=friendly]{javascript}
if (Meteor.isClient) {
  // This code only runs on the client
  Template.body.helpers({
    tasks: [
      { text: "This is task 1" },
      { text: "This is task 2" },
      { text: "This is task 3" }
    ]
  });
}
\end{minted}

If we do not need a style, the |style=default| setting will typeset as,

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize,style=trac]{javascript}
if (Meteor.isClient) {
  // This code only runs on the client
  Template.body.helpers({
    tasks: [
      { text: "This is task 1" },
      { text: "This is task 2" },
      { text: "This is task 3" }
    ]
  });
}
\end{minted}

You can also set the style for the whole document using:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize,style=trac]{TeX}
\usemintedstyle{<name>}
\end{minted}
where you can get <name> by typing

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize,style=bw]{bash}
$ pygmentize -L styles
\end{minted}
at the command prompt/terminal. For example, the minted documentation itself uses the |trac| style.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize,style=friendly]{html}
<!-- First set the doctype -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Canvas</title>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <style>
          #square {
            border: 1px solid black;
                    transform: scale(10) rotate(3deg) translateX(0px);
                    -moz-transform: scale(10) rotate(3deg) translateX(0px);
          }

          .box {              
                    transition-duration: 2s;
                    transition-property: transform;
                    transition-timing-function: linear;
          }
        </style>
      </head>
      <body>
        <canvas id="square" width="200" height="200"></canvas>
        <script>
                var canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
                canvas.width = 200;
                canvas.height = 200;

                var image = new Image();
                image.src = 'images/card.png';
                image.width = 114;
                image.height = 158;
                image.onload = window.setInterval(function() {
                    rotation();
                }, 1000/60);
       </script>
      </body>
    </html>
\end{minted} 
   



\begin{lstlisting}

printf("hello, world");V\colorbox{green}{**}V
return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}



\chapter{Documentation Macros}


\section{Documentation macros}

When developing this package the need arose to define a number of documentation macros. I~have used heavily macros and ideas present in the \pkg{doc} package, \pkg{pgf} documentation, \pkg{biblatex} documentation  and \pkg{tcolorbox} and for which I am grateful to their respective authors. The major change was to adopt the macros to use different fonts and colors and to use these from a list of key values defined at document level. More about this later. General package user documentation as opposed to package documentation that can be achieved using the |doc/docstrip| system requires that macros and environments be developed for the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Macros for command documentation.
\item Environments for commands and options.
\item Latex examples that need to be executed within the document as well as described.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Commands and Styles for Documenting macros}

The most commonly used commands for documenting macros are |\cs|, |\cmd|, |\meta|, |\marg|, |\oarg|. These commands have been defined by many authors and perhaps the best implementation can be found in the \pkg{doc}. Many package authors have redefined them in their documention, some if just to add a bit of colour, others to have them add the command to an index. As we also had a target to allow for
the package to be used in both normal documents as well as documentation
of packages and classes that use the \pkg{doc} and \pkg{docstrip} combination we provided many compatible macros.

\begin{environment}{macro} The environment macro is made available in this
package. 
\end{environment}

\DescribeMacro{macro} The environment macro is made available in this package. 

\begin{macro}{\cmd} The command \cmd{\cmd} typesets its argument in
  verbatim. Typing |\cmd{\cmd}| typsets \cmd{\cmd}. If the class
  |ltxdoc| is loaded the command is defined there. We have modified
  it to accept a colour and changes to the verbatim font 
  for consistency.
\end{macro}

\begin{macro}{meta}
The macro \cs{meta} is normally used to build other commands. On its own it can be used to typeset
examples of the argument of macros, typing |meta{Aristotle}| will typeset meta{Aristotle}. The command provides a hook to set the font via a macro |\meta@font@select|. 
\end{macro}


|\def\meta@font@select{\upshape\color{black}}|


\subsection{Color management}
One of the first requirements for redefining some of the standard doc commands is the need to use color easily, hence we will try and define a certain amount of keys for colors.

Just a bit of a refresher, to define colors we use, either the \cs{definecolor} or the \cs{colorlet} commands.

\emphasis{definecolor,colorlet}

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small]{TeX}
\definecolor{Hyperlink}{rgb}{0.281,0.275,0.485}
\colorlet{thehyperlink}{theblue}
\end{minted}


We use a semantic approach, where the colors are first defined with a mnemonic command such as {\bfseries\textcolor{theblue}{theblue}} and then we define a semantic command such as the\cs{option} that lets the color to the option command. This sort of double entry has proved useful in navigating through the dozen of the commands that I needed for this documentation.


\subsection{Semantic color names}
\begin{marglist}
\item [\option{theoption}] Coloring of options in margin lists.
\item [\option{themacro}] Coloring of command macros \cs{foo}.
\item [\option{hyperlink}] If we use the \texttt{hyperref} package a number of colors need to be defined for links.
\end{marglist}

\subsection{Named colors}
Standard colors that we provide are:
\begin{marglist}
\item [\textcolor{theblue}{theblue}] This color is used mainly for options.
\item [\textcolor{thered}{thered}] The color mostly used for macro commands and keys.
\item [\textcolor{thegreen}{thegreen}] used for environments.
\item [\textcolor{thelightgreen}{thelightgreen}] Used for margin lists.
\item [\textcolor{thegray}{thegray}] Used as a background to the listings.
\item [\colorbox{thegrey}{\color{white}thegrey}] Alias for the gray to satisfy both sides of the Atlantic and as I sometimes don't remeber which is which.
\item [\colorbox{theshade}{theshade}] Another slightly lighter shade.
\end{marglist}



\begin{marglist}
\item [\cs{cs}] \cs{cs} text Prints a command.
\item [\cs{cmd}] Prints a command.
\end{marglist}




\section{Lists for documentation}



The environment \env{marglist}
\begin{marglist}
\item[testing]\lorem
\item [test]\lorem
\end{marglist}

\env{keymarginlist}This environment is suitable for listing keys, set-in the margin.

\begin{keymarglist}
\item[bibliography] The term <bibliography>, also available as \cmd{\bibname}.
\item[references] The term <references>, also available as \cmd{refname}.
\item[shorthands] The term <list of shorthands> or <list of abbreviations>, also available as \cmd{losname}.
\end{keymarglist}


\env{argumentlist} This environment is suitable for listing macro arguments and their explanations.



\section{Breakable Boxes}

The \pkg{mdframed} as well as the newer versions of \pkg{tcolorbox}
offer breakable boxes.


\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced, breakable,
  colback=blue!5!white,colframe=blue!75!black,title=Breakable box,
  watermark color=white,watermark text=\Roman{tcbbreakpart}]
  \lipsum[1-3]
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{PGF Style Code Boxes}

\begin{codeexample}[]
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node[place,label=above:$p_1$,tokens=2]        (p1) {};
  \node[place,label=below:$p_2\ge1$,right=of p1] (p2) {};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{codeexample}
