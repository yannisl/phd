\section{Linked Lists}

Because tables are dynamic entities, it is easy to implement linked lists in Lua. We represent each node
with a table (what else?); links are simply table fields that contain references to other tables. For instance,
let us implement a singly-linked list, where each node has two fields, value and next. A simple variable
is the list root:

|list = nil|
