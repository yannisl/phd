\chapter{Pattern Matching}

The |string| library of Lua, offers a number of pattern matching functions. Unlike many other languages it does not offer a full regular expression library. One can take this at first to be a disantvantage, but the reasons are explained in \textit{Programming in Lua} by Roberto Ierusalimschy, clearly:

\begin{latexquotation}
Unlike several other scripting languages, Lua uses neither \texttt{POSIX} regex nor
Perl regular expressions for pattern matching. The main reason for this decision
is size: a typical implementation of \texttt{POSIX} regular expressions takes more than
4000 lines of code. This is about the size of all Lua standard libraries together.
In comparison, the implementation of pattern matching in Lua has less than
600 lines. Of course, pattern matching in Lua cannot do all that a full POSIX
implementation does. Nevertheless, pattern matching in Lua is a powerful tool,
and includes some features that are difficult to match with standard POSIX
implementations.
\end{latexquotation}

The most powerful functions in the string library are find, match, \luacmd{gsub} (Global
Substitution), and \luacmd{gmatch} (Global Match). They all are based on patterns.


\luacmd{string.find()}
searches for a pattern inside a given subject string. The simplest form of a \textit{pattern} is a word, which matches only a copy of itself.

For instance, the pattern ‘Lua’ will search for the substring “Lua” inside the
subject string. When |find| finds its pattern, it returns two values: the \textit{index} where the match begins and the index where the match ends. If it does not find a match, it returns |nil|. Example~\ref{ex:patterns1} demonstrates the |find| function. We use the |luacode| environment to avoid dealing with catcodes and we format the results in maths mode.

\begin{texexample}{Pattern Matching with find}{ex:patterns1}
\begin{luacode*}
s = "hello Lua world"
i, j = string.find(s,"Lua")
tex.print("indices $i="..i..",".."j="..j.."$")

tex.print(number.formatted(1234.56,"!","?"))

local print=tex.print

print(string.unquoted("test"))

print(string.unquoted([["t\"est"]]))

print(string.unquoted([["t\"est"x]]))

print(string.unquoted("\'test\'"))

print(string.unquoted('"test"'))

print(string.unquoted('"test"'))


print(number.decimaltobyte(12345.67))
\end{luacode*}
\end{texexample}

\luacmd{string.sub}
When a match succeeds, we can call string.sub with the values returned by
string.find to get the part of the subject string that matched the pattern. For
simple patterns, this is the pattern itself.

The string.find function has an optional third parameter: an index that
tells where in the subject string to start the search. This parameter is useful
when we want to process all the indices where a given pattern appears: we
search for a new match repeatedly, each time starting after the position where
we found the previous one. As an example, the following code makes a table
with the positions of all newlines in a string:

We will see later a simpler way to write such loops, using the \luacmd{string.gmatch}
iterator.

\begin{texexample}{Iterating over all matches}{}
\edef\tempstring{\string\\par..is this is a is test \string\\par and is this another?}
\begin{luacode}
local s = "\tempstring".."This is is a string and this is another"
local t = {}
local i= 0
while true do
    i = string.find(s, "\\par", i+1)
    if i == nil then break end
    t[#t + 1] = i
    tex.print(i)
end
   
\end{luacode}
\end{texexample}


\section{The string.match function}


The string.match function is similar to string.find, in the sense that it also
searches for a pattern in a string. However, instead of returning the positions
where it found the pattern, it returns the part of the subject string that matched
the pattern:
print(string.match("hello world", "hello")) --> hello
For fixed patterns like ‘hello’, this function is pointless. It shows its power when
used with variable patterns, as in the next example:

\begin{texexample}{string.match}{}
\begin{luacode}
date = "Today is 18/11/2014 is about time to get serious with LuaTeX."
d = string.match(date, "%d+/%d+/%d+")
tex.print(d) 
\end{luacode}
\end{texexample}

\section{Patterns}

Patterns can be more useful with \textit{character classes}. 

\begin{longtable}{>{\color{blue}}ll}
. & all characters\\
\%a & letters\\
\%c &control characters\\
\%d &digits\\ 
\%g &printable characters except spaces\\
\%l &lower-case letters\\
\%p &punctuation characters\\
\%s &space characters\\
\%u  &upper-case letters\\
\%w  &alphanumeric characters\\
\%x  &hexadecimal digits\\
\end{longtable}

You can make patterns still more useful with modifiers for repetitions and optional parts. Patterns in Lua offer four modifiers:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
+	&1 or more repetitions\\
*	&0 or more repetitions\\
-	&also 0 or more repetitions\\
?	&optional (0 or 1 occurrence)\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
