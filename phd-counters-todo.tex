1. On final round add pkg options. This was left as last in order not to solve problems by adding
    options. Too many options are not a good User Interface.
2.  Finish symbol management, both text and math. Math already 80% incorporated.
3.  Better integration of indexing commands.
4.  Revisit layout manager for Chapters. Broke again in tests.
5.  Docs. Add all references.
6.  Incorporate phd class for more flexibility.
7.  Improve package manager.
8.  Group script loading for better font management.
9.  General font management to relook it again.
10. Add all style sections (about 100 already prepared). Once they
     are all working issue beta version.
